1,Bonza  The ‘bogan’ airline has had a tough year – but it may finally be about to take off              A frustrating wait for approval to fly has left Australia’s new low-cost carrier on the sidelines as demand and airfares soar. Now the credibility of its brand faces the real test            The ‘bogan’ airline has had a tough year – but it may finally be about to take off,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/07/bonza-the-bogan-airline-has-had-a-tough-year-but-it-may-finally-be-about-to-take-off,"Bonza, the soon-to-launch airline branding itself as a “bogan” carrier offering ultra-low-cost air fares and purple budgie smugglers, will be seriously tested by the soaring cost of jet fuel, experts say, as the carrier enters the final stage of regulatory approval.Almost a year after it hoped to be in the skies, Bonza has begun conducting proving flights from Sunshine Coast airport to demonstrate to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (Casa) that its systems and processes are ready to enter the market, after it submitted key components of its application to the regulator in the days before Christmas, Guardian Australia understands.Casa says it will make a decision after the proving flights are completed in early January.Bonza generated headlines in October 2021 when it announced its intention to become Australia’s first ultra-low-cost carrier, with hopes to begin flying by early 2022.Consumer watchdog puts Australian airlines on notice over high domestic air faresRead moreIts chief executive, Tim Jordan, said Bonza would focus mostly on leisure destinations and routes without an existing non-stop service, and would avoid flights between capital cities.After issuing a call out to regional councils to gauge their interest in attracting the airline’s services, it has set up its base on the Sunshine Coast. It initially plans to offer services to 17 airports, including Cairns, the Whitsunday Coast, Melbourne, Port Macquarie, Newcastle and Mildura – but not Sydney.Bonza is backed by the US private investment firm 777 Partners, which funds several budget carriers around the world. The firm plans to lease to Bonza eight Boeing 737-8 Max planes – it has already received three, which it named Sheila, Shazza and Bazza.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundupThose names are part of the branding campaign Bonza has driven since it first presented its purple colour scheme. Budgie smugglers and bikinis featuring the airline’s logo will be sold onboard, with an inflight atmosphere Jordan expects to be shaped by “holidaymakers, bachelor parties, leisure and fun”.Cabin crew will wear sneakers and shorts, and will be allowed to mix and match their own uniforms, while passengers won’t be able to book tickets through Bonza’s website – only through its smartphone app.Despite the fanfare, Bonza has been plagued by misfortune. The airline has been waiting for regulatory approval during a year of strong domestic travel. Crucially, it is now missing out on the school holiday boom, with budget domestic airfares at highs not seen since 2004 and airlines posting record profits thanks to Australians’ soaring appetite for travelling after pandemic restrictions were lifted.The airline also received some unwelcome publicity thanks to its shirt sponsorship of the of A-League club Melbourne Victory, which is the subject of sanctions after a violent pitch invasion last month.Fun, effective or ‘very bland’? Advertising experts split on Australia’s tourism mascot Ruby the RooRead moreIn early 2022, the airline said customers should expect to pay about $50 for every hour they are in the air. Tony Webber, a former chief economist at Qantas, says that promise could be impossible to keep without making a loss, given that jet fuel prices have almost doubled in the past year.Webber, who now heads the Airline Intelligence and Research group, says budget carriers are particularly sensitive to oil price fluctuations, as jet fuel makes up a larger proportion of their operating costs compared with full-service airlines. He believes for Bonza this figure could be as much as 35%.“Their unit costs could be almost double what they were using to calculate that $50 per hour promise,” Webber says. To gain regulatory approval, Bonza must show it is financially viable, and Webber suggests this may have been a factor in delaying the process.Adam Ferrier, a consumer psychologist and founder of the advertising firm Thinkerbell, who has done work for Jetstar, says Bonza has given itself “very little room to manoeuvre in terms of pricing”.“If you look really cheap, then you actually have to be really, really cheap.”Sign up to Five Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

I’m not saying it will or won’t work, it’s just a little dangerous.”Ferrier says Bonza needs to balance its “strong personality” with a projection of safety and professionalism, brand qualities which “are absolutely paramount in an airline”.He recalls how Jordan previously ran the Philippine budget carrier Cebu Airlines, when the airline would allow basketball to be played down the aisle.“You can have fun which is not at the expense of professionalism, but when you’re calling your planes Sheila, Bazza and Shazza, I’d be worried of going too far,” Ferrier says. “You do see brands trying to dial up their Australianness, such as Bunnings … but very few go into the ‘G’day mate how ya goin’ space.”Paradise paused: Asia-Pacific tourism continues to lag after the Covid induced freezeRead moreWebber says Bonza’s blown-out launch date will be seen as “a major issue” internally. “Each day they’re not in the air, it’s costing them.”Webber calculates that given Bonza have already taken delivery of three aircraft, at an estimated combined cost of about $300m, the airline would need to earn $60m a year from its operations just to make a return on its investment given the lifespan of aircraft.“Conservatively they’re probably losing close to $1m a week, in terms of opportunity cost of what they’re forfeiting, and that’s not considering actual staff costs, just from the fact they’re not able to make money off the aircraft they’ve bought.”Bonza has about 90 staff, according to LinkedIn. The company would not confirm its current number of employees, saying only that it had been “actively recruiting 200-plus roles including inflight crew and support roles”.Webber estimates Bonza would already be paying an annual wage bill of about $9m, based on industry averages.“They’re burning through money and they’re missing out on exceptionally strong demand for air travel at the moment, which will really be hurting them.”But Webber plays down any suggestion Bonza will fail to take off, despite all its problems, as its parent company has invested too much. Instead, he predicts, the business will just have to wait longer to become profitable. “I think they’ll stick it out.”Jordan declined to be interviewd, but provided a written statement.“We remain fully focussed on the regulatory process and continue to work with Casa on it,” the statement said.“They do incredibly important work regulating aviation in Australia and we respect the process we’re working through with them. It is wrong of us to comment on when that process will be completed.”"
2,Prince Harry  Army veterans criticise claim he killed 25 Taliban in Afghanistan              Col Tim Collins says ‘we don’t do notches on rifle butt’ and kill-count talk could increase Harry’s personal security risk              Memoir Duke saw ‘red mist’ in William during alleged attack    What's in the book? Here’s all we know so far    Memoir Duke saw ‘red mist’ in William during alleged attack    What's in the book? Here’s all we know so far  Army veterans criticise claim he killed 25 Taliban in Afghanistan,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/06/army-veterans-criticise-prince-harry-claim-killed-25-taliban-afghanistan,"High-profile British veterans have criticised the Duke of Sussex’s claim he had killed 25 Taliban soldiers while serving with the British army in Afghanistan and warned the high-profile admission could increase the risk to his personal security.The retired army veteran Col Tim Collins, best known for delivering a rousing speech before the start of the Iraq war in 2003, said the prince’s kill-count talk was crass and “we don’t do notches on the rifle butt”.Others said Harry had appeared wrongly to dehumanise the insurgents by describing them as “chess pieces removed from the board”, while the Taliban accused the prince of committing war crimes on his tour a decade ago.Anas Haqqani, an influential member of the Afghan government, said: “The ones you killed were not chess pieces, they were humans; they had families who were waiting for their return. Among the killers of Afghans, not many have your decency to reveal their conscience and confess to their war crimes.”The kill-count claim features in Harry’s autobiography, Spare, and comes from the Times’s translation of the Spanish edition of his book. The prince recounts in his memoir his time as a gunner in an Apache attack helicopter while on his second tour in Afghanistan in 2012. It was possible to establish a kill count, the prince said, because he was able to watch gun-cam footage of every mission he flew on.What’s in Prince Harry’s memoir Spare? Here’s all we know so farRead moreHarry writes that “in the era of Apaches and laptops” it was possible to establish “with exactness how many enemy combatants I had killed. And it seemed to me essential not to be afraid of that number. So my number is 25. It’s not a number that fills me with satisfaction, but nor does it embarrass me.”Later the prince acknowledged that he had dehumanised those who he had shot in battle: “When I found myself plunged in the heat and confusion of combat I didn’t think of those 25 as people. They were chess pieces removed from the board. Bad people eliminated before they could kill good people.”Collins, in an interview with Forces News, took issue with Harry’s comments. “Amongst his assertions is a claim that he killed 25 people in Afghanistan. That’s not how you behave in the army; it’s not how we think. He has badly let the side down. We don’t do notches on the rifle butt. We never did.”The former soldier accused Harry of engaging in “a tragic moneymaking scam to fund the lifestyle he can’t afford” that, in a barely concealed sideswipe at his wife, Meghan, was something “someone else has chosen”.Other Afghanistan veterans questioned how far Harry could be sure of how many people he had killed. A former para said: “I’ve never heard anyone talk about kill counts, it’s crass and frankly cringeworthy. Taking a life is the most serious thing you can ever do on ops, serious people don’t talk it up as a game to shift a few books.”While it is not uncommon for soldiers to watch back gun-cam footage to analyse how the mission had unfolded, the Afghan veteran added, “You can’t always tell who has been killed or injured. No one is going into a flattened building to check.”A former British army commander in Afghanistan, retired Col Richard Kemp, said the comments may put the prince’s security at greater risk. Extremists who support the Taliban may now be “motivated to kill Harry” because of memories that have been “resurrected” by his comments, he told Sky News.Sign up to The Guardian Headlines UKFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines emailed direct to you every week dayPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At one point in the legal battle, his lawyers said the prince “does not feel safe” when he is visiting the UK, after a string of threats and incidents, including from far-right extremists.There was unease at the comments from some British Muslims, including from those who have publicly supported Harry and Meghan in the past, but continued their support, at least for her.Zillur Rahman, a lawyer specialising in defamation, said last year that “false and unhinged” articles written about the couple were “exactly” what the Muslim community have experienced. But of Harry’s comments about killing 25 people, he said: “We have seen a focus on a number of killings in Afghanistan, which in some cases have included innocent civilians. I don’t know who the targets were in Harry’s case but of course I find them distasteful.“It may well be that when he was in the army that was what his life was like, and I would hope that he has moved on and changed his views, but if this is what the army was instilling in its personnel and how they were being educated to view others then it should be examined. Is this the mindset of the army and does it explain why some atrocities were committed?”A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said the military would not discuss Harry’s kill count claim: “We do not comment on operational details for security reasons.”British forces were engaged in combat operations in Afghanistan between 2001 and 2014, and training efforts thereafter, before the west finally withdrew in chaotic circumstances in summer 2021. The Taliban took over in August that year, before the final withdrawal had been completed."
3,"‘Happy to let it hang out’  Budgie smugglers are back on Australian beaches                Australian men have their reasons for pulling these tight togs back on. For some it’s irony; for others, pride. But for many it is simply a matter of comfort              Budgie smugglers are back on Australian beaches",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jan/07/happy-to-let-it-hang-out-budgie-smugglers-are-back-on-australian-beaches,"In the birthplace of the budgie smuggler, men are freeing their thighs in increasing numbers, embracing a style so daring that it even led to arrests in 1961.The style’s return to prominence has seen traditional brands move millions of dollars of togs, while a new wave of independent designers are redefining the classic look.Through the 1900s, budgies went from almost illegal to the symbol of daggy dads. They are now re-emerging in the mainstream, Maritime Museum assistant curator Inger Sheil says.The full brief: how to buy men’s underwear that will last the distanceRead more“In terms of their popularity, it does ebb and flow. “People ironically and unironically enjoy wearing them … there’s still a lot of humour around them.”That humour can be seen in name alone. The term “budgie smuggler” refers to a small Australian parrot, the budgerigar, that wearers appear to be concealing in their swimwear.But the aquatic loin cloth comes with other handles: togs, sluggos, the more crass “dick stickers”, and of course, the original moniker: Speedos. That brand name is so synonymous with the style, it has become generic in Australia, the “hoover” or “Post-it” of the beach.Swimmers, including Australian Allan Wood, resting at the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games. Photograph: John Konrads/Australian National Maritime Museum CollectionIn 1959, budgie smugglers were born when artist and surfer Peter Travis created the relaxed style for Speedo. They instantly caused a stir.“[Surf lifesaver and beach inspector] Aub Laidlaw was infamous for measuring women’s swimsuits and arresting women or asking them to leave the beach,” Sheil says.“But it’s less well known that in 1961 he had males wearing these Speedo briefs arrested as well.”The charges were later dropped because the swimsuits hid any pubic hair, making the level of modesty lawful, but “you had this tension between morality and fashion,” Sheil says. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningBy the eve of the 70s, showing skin on the sand was no longer a question. “Controversy over it perished.” An egalitarian view of the tight togs eventually won out, so much so, that prime ministers wanted to be seen in them. In 1974, Gough Whitlam was photographed buying a bright orange and pink pair; in 1986, Bob Hawke was captured watching the cricket while sunbathing in his briefs.From Malcolm Fraser to Malcolm Turnbull, budgies have helped male politicians signal they are just everyday blokes, Sheil says.Most notable, perhaps though, was Australian conservative PM Tony Abbott, whose love of Speedos, she says, became “the cartoonist’s favourite image”.Former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott was renowned for his love of budgie smugglers. Illustration: Steve Bell/The Guardian Possibly thanks to political dad energy, from the 1990s to the 2010s togs lost their broader appeal.But writer and broadcaster Benjamin Law points out there is one place they have never fallen out of favour: gay culture.“Per fashion in general, queer people are on trend first and everyone follows,” Law says. “So it’s no surprise straight people are becoming more comfortable wearing them now.”Togs are not just contentious in Australia - international opinion is divided. Europeans love them, Americans hate them. Photograph: David Madison/Getty ImagesGrowing up in Queensland meant budgie smugglers were “mandatory” at swimming carnivals. And yet what horrified Law as a child delights him as an adult - he loves to snap a Speedo selfie.“As a gay guy in Sydney, it’s now standard uniform,” he says. But it has moved beyond the scene. “If you’re doing laps at the local pool or if you’re swimming at [famed Bondi ocean pool] Icebergs and you’re not wearing them, you’re the odd one out.”Travis was a gay man, but in 2008 he told DNA Magazine that his design’s enduring popularity with his community was “just a bonus”. Really, the cut was about comfort, with Travis saying that, “If you lifted your leg as high as you could, that is the shape.”Sign up to Saved for LaterFree weekly newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Men’s magazine Cobber champions independent brands  that are releasing playful takes. Photograph: Jackson Gallagher/Cobber MagAs it still is today, Law says. The ubiquity of the brief “sounds like peer pressure but it’s liberating”.“People might look at bikinis and budgie smugglers and assume Sydney is so vain,” he says. “But as a committed swimmer he has noticed that “no one gives a shit what your body looks like”.“Everyone is just kind of happy to let it hang out.”Creative director of men’s magazine Cobber, Rhys Ripper, goes one step further, talking up the flattering nature of togs.“Of course, men want to look great,” says Ripper. “They’re picking pieces that make their legs look better. Showing it off.”Ripper is helping drive the trend. His styling frequently uses togs and he champions independent brands, like Gali and Pool, that are releasing playful takes. For Mark Calleja, a love of comfort and the increasing availability of interesting togs has resulted in an entire wardrobe of them. The 47-year-old, who lives in Brisbane, owns around 100 pairs.“In the last six years, whenever there is a pair I like I just keep my eye on them until there is a sale,” he says.“I don’t go overboard, but I’m building a little collection. They’ve become a slight addiction, but nothing I can’t handle.”Budgie smuggler enthusiast Mark Calleja with some of the more than 100 pairs he owns.

Photograph: Dan Peled/Guardian AustraliaAs a gay man, Calleja says he has always loved them – even when they were out of fashion. While he says “they’ve been a bit of a stigma”, he adds “I’ve never had a problem”.“They look good, they’re less restrictive, I’ve just always preferred them.”Togs are not just contentious in Australia - international opinion is divided. Europeans love them, Americans hate them. Everyone is perplexed by the name. But Australians should embrace them as their own, Ripper says.“A lot of Australians have grown up wearing them, it’s part of our culture.”“If it’s not part of your culture, you’re going to worry. You’re going to worry about the size of your penis or if your bum looks good, but if you’re bought up around them, you’re oblivious to it.”With straight men starting to re-embrace the more revealing look, there is one other reason the togs have stayed a staple on Australian beaches.“Fashion cycles around,” Sheil says. “But they never entirely left us because they are comfortable.”"
4,Mental health  Younger girls increasingly presenting to Australian hospitals in distress Younger girls increasingly presenting to Australian hospitals in distress,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/07/younger-girls-increasingly-presenting-to-australian-hospitals-in-mental-distress,"Younger girls are increasingly attending emergency departments in mental distress or having self-harmed, Australian doctors say, while young women have the highest increase in antidepressant use.Two new studies published in the Australian & New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry reveal alarming levels of mental illness among young people, particularly teenage girls who are least likely to be admitted to hospital when seeking treatment.The first study, led by the New South Wales Ministry of Health, examined emergency presentations for suicidal ideation and self-harm by 10-to-24-year-olds between 2015 and 2021.When a teenager tells you about their mental health issues you have to listen to the expert – themselves | Saretta LeeRead morePresentations were increasing by 8.4% each year before the pandemic but the study found “growth accelerated since Covid to 19.2% per annum, primarily due to increased presentations by females aged 13–17  years”.Presentations in males aged 10 to 24 years did not increase since Covid.Meanwhile, a study led by the Centre for Big Data Research in Health at the University of NSW examined national prescribing data for people aged 10 and above between 2015 and 2021, finding antidepressant use continued to increase in Australia, especially among young people.During the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, antidepressant use was “greater among females than males, and greater among young females than other age groups, suggesting an increased mental health burden in populations already on a trajectory of increased use of antidepressants prior to the pandemic,” the paper found.The greatest increase in antidepressant use was in females aged 10 to 17  years old.Youth psychiatrist Associate Prof Elizabeth Scott from the University of Sydney’s Brain and Mind Centre said she was seeing young people present to emergency “at much earlier ages”.“Generally we saw 15-to-17-year-olds, and that went down to 13-to-15-year-olds especially during the pandemic,” she said. “Teenagers rely on social connection for their wellbeing, particularly young girls.”Scott said it wasn’t just the pandemic to blame, with rates of youth distress increasing prior to Covid. But she said the pandemic exacerbated existing issues, such as loneliness and isolation, worry about the future, body image concerns often driven by social media, and difficulty seeking mental health help.“Young people and their parents come looking for help, but the help isn’t there, with long waiting lists so it’s impossible to see a psychologist or psychiatrist and receive that consistent care,” Scott said.Social media may affect girls’ mental health earlier than boys’, study findsRead more“Young people end up presenting to emergency departments with no other care network available.”Scott said young women were also more likely to be sent home from hospital given men have higher rates of suicide. “Young men are more likely to get admitted,” Scott said. “That’s often because of comorbidities like drug and alcohol use or aggressive behaviour and other behaviours that are more likely to lead to admission.”Prof Susan Sawyer, the chair of adolescent health at the University of Melbourne and the director of the Royal Children’s hospital Centre for Adolescent Health, said there had rightly been a strong focus during the pandemic on the vulnerability of the elderly.“But I think we really failed to, in any way, think about a focus on prevention and health issues in terms of what these might mean for younger people,” she said.“The Royal Children’s hospital runs a major eating disorder service, and there have been very dramatic increases in those disorders over the course of the pandemic. But this was, in a sense, preventable. It’s not just something ‘in the air’ causing this.“There are preventable causes of emotional distress. Whilst as a community there is increasing recognition of the importance of ageing well, we’re really failing as a community to think about the sorts of long-term investments we need to be making in our young people.”Sawyer believes young people need to be given more credit and appreciation for their ideas and provided with opportunities to contribute to their communities.Opportunities to participate in school, community sport, part-time work and recreation were limited during the pandemic, she said, but were critical for children and teenagers to develop social connections and life skills that build resilience.Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78; Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636"

A Brazilian cactus planted by her husband, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, during his 2003-10 presidency had reportedly been removed. Bolsonaro left a disposable ballpoint pen – one of the symbols of his populist administration – on one of the palace’s desks.Bolsonaro, who abandoned Brasília on the eve of Lula’s swearing-in last Sunday, looks unlikely to return soon. He is in Florida, and reportedly fears prosecution for alleged crimes including his anti-scientific response to a Covid pandemic that killed nearly 700,000 people in his country.A report in the Brazilian magazine Istoé this week claimed the former president was pressuring the Italian government to grant his family citizenship and hoped to move there after a stint in the US to avoid jail. Bolsonaro reportedly believed Brazilian authorities would be unable to extradite him from the European country, from where his great-grandfather Vittorio Bolzonaro emigrated in the late 19th century."
6,Roman Abramovich  Leak reveals billion-dollar trusts transferred before Russia sanctions Leak reveals billion-dollar trusts transferred before Russia sanctions,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/06/roman-abramovich-trusts-transfer-leak-russia-sanctions,"Trusts holding billions of dollars of assets for Roman Abramovich were amended to transfer beneficial ownership to his children shortly before sanctions were imposed on the Russian oligarch.Leaked files seen by the Guardian suggest 10 secretive offshore trusts established to benefit Abramovich were rapidly reorganised in early February 2022, three weeks before the start of Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine.The sweeping reorganisation of Abramovich’s financial affairs commenced just days after governments threatened to impose sanctions against Russian oligarchs in the event of an invasion.Q&AWhat are the Oligarch files?ShowThe Oligarch files is a cache of leaked confidential documents containing emails, banking records, company filings, trust documents and compliance reports. The files originate from the Cyprus-based offshore service provider MeritServus. Located in Limassol, MeritServus helps its clients set up and manage offshore companies and trusts to shelter their wealth. Cyprus, an EU member state, has long served as a major offshore financial centre for wealthy Russians who have favoured the Mediterranean island as a destination to harbour their fortunes. Roman Abramovich appears to have been a client of MeritServus for more than 20 years. Holding assets in offshore havens such as Cyprus, sometimes via trusts, is not in or of itself illegal, and there are legitimate reasons why some people do it. The files were shared with the Guardian by an anonymous third party. A file in the leak suggests the data was obtained by hackers calling themselves ""Freaky crew"". The Guardian is only publishing stories based on files in the leak where it believes there is a public interest justification for doing so.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The leaked documents raise questions about whether the changes to trusts were made in an attempt to shield the oligarch’s vast fortune from the threat of asset freezes.Analysis suggests the amendments made Abramovich’s seven children, the youngest of whom is nine years old, beneficiaries of trusts holding assets worth at least $4bn, though the total value could be much higher.The changes appear to have made the children the ultimate beneficial owners of trophy assets long-linked to their father, including luxury properties and a fleet of superyachts, helicopters and private jets.The Eclipse in Nice, France. The 163-metre superyacht has nine decks and two helipads. Photograph: Valéry Hache/AFP/Getty ImagesSanctions experts said the sweeping reorganisation of the trusts could complicate efforts to enforce sanctions against the oligarch and potentially frustrate attempts to freeze assets previously believed to belong to the metals tycoon.The revelations are likely to raise questions about whether Abramovich’s children should also be subject to asset freezes. Unlike family members of some of Putin’s closest advisers, many families of oligarchs subject to sanctions have avoided restrictions.UK and EU governments have cast Abramovich as a pro-Kremlin oligarch and in March 2022 imposed sanctions on him for allegedly benefiting from close relations with Putin. Abramovich has denied financial ties to the Kremlin and filed legal action to overturn the EU’s measures.Q&AWhat is a trust?ShowA trust is a legal arrangement created when someone (a settlor) places assets under the control of a third party (a trustee) for the benefit of someone else (a beneficiary).Assets held by a trust could include cash, shares in companies, real estate or other physical assets. Trusts can be used for many reasons such as asset protection, tax planning or managing family assets for future generations. Crucially, trusts separate the legal ownership of an asset from its beneficial ownership. A trust’s asset may be legally owned by the trustee but held for the benefit of the underlying beneficial owner. A trust’s assets are managed by the trustee in accordance with the trust’s governing document and instructions made by the settlor. Trusts are often overseen by a protector – appointed by the settlor – to monitor the trustee’s administration of the trust’s assets.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Abramovich, who holds Russian, Israeli and Portuguese citizenship, has not been added to the US sanctions list. Ukraine reportedly asked the White House not to impose sanctions against him after the businessman emerged as an unofficial mediator in peace negotiations.The files appear to have been obtained through a hack of a Cyprus-based offshore service provider that administers the Abramovich trusts. The large cache of documents was shared anonymously with the Guardian.The files illustrate how Abramovich has for decades used opaque trust structures to shelter his wealth in secretive offshore havens, and point to the challenges western authorities face in piercing these complex structures to enforce sanctions.Abramovich’s financial holdings have come under intense scrutiny since the invasion. Authorities in Jersey have tried to freeze $7bn in assets in the Channel Islands, while the US has seized two of his private jets for violating export controls.The FBI said in court filings at the time that it believed Abramovich had reorganised two trusts, one of which held the seized jets, by making his children beneficiaries.The leaked files, however, suggest the reorganisation was more far-reaching.Roman Abramovich and his daughter Sofia watch Chelsea football club play at Stamford Bridge in London in 2017. Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPAIn a burst of activity in February 2022, shortly before the invasion, Abramovich was removed as a beneficiary of the two trusts identified by the FBI. Meanwhile, his children were appointed as beneficiaries of eight additional trusts established to benefit their father.Sanctions experts said the changes may have been a deliberate but not unlawful attempt to distance the oligarch from his wealth before sanctions were imposed.The reorganisation, they said, could present challenges for authorities now pursuing assets long-believed to be owned by Abramovich as they determine who in reality owns and controls the multibillion-dollar fortune: the oligarch or his children. Abramovich and his children did not respond to detailed requests for comment.Reorganisation of luxury assetsIn February 2022, a day after Russian tanks rolled across Ukraine’s borders, Abramovich’s 25-year-old daughter, Sofia, reportedly shared a post on Instagram with a stridently anti-war message.Featuring an image of the Russian president blocked out with a red line, it read: “The biggest and most successful lie of Kremlin’s propaganda is that most Russians stand with Putin.”But for Sofia and her six other siblings, the beginning of Russia’s war against Ukraine marked another significant milestone: it was the day they in effect became billionaires.On 24 February, as Russian fighter jets began bombing Kyiv, the finishing touches were made to an extensive reorganisation of their father’s offshore affairs set in motion three weeks earlier.Details of the reorganisation of the trusts are laid bare in the apparently hacked files. Photograph: Martin Meissner/APUntil that month, Abramovich was the sole beneficiary of at least 10 Cyprus and Jersey trusts, documents suggest. But on 4 February – almost in one fell swoop – the trusts began to be amended to appoint Abramovich’s seven children as beneficiaries.Files suggest the changes granted the children – five of whom are now adults – a collective 51%, or in some cases 100%, beneficial interest in the trusts’ assets. These range from shares in large Russian companies to more eye-catching physical assets such as the Eclipse, a superyacht with nine decks and two helipads.The 163-metre vessel, long-believed to be owned by Abramovich, is ultimately held by the Europa Trust. Documents show Abramovich was removed as the trust’s beneficiary and replaced with his children. At the end of 2021, companies it controlled held assets worth $2.6bn, according to the files.Details of the reorganisation of the trusts are laid bare in the Oligarch files, a cache of apparently hacked files from the offshore provider MeritServus, which has managed Abramovich’s financial interests for more than 20 years.Demetris Ioannides, the chair and managing partner of MeritServus, did not respond to detailed requests for comment, saying the firm is prevented from disclosure of information to third parties, citing European data protection rules and UK case law, on which Cypriot trust laws are based. However, he added: “The paramount responsibility of a trustee is to protect the assets of a trust.”The documents offer a snapshot of the oligarch’s fortune on the eve of the invasion and illustrate how his trusts have held a myriad network of companies in secretive jurisdictions and funded an extravagant lifestyle.Prince headlined at a private concert in the Caribbean for Roman Abramovich in 2015, according to reports. Photograph: Bertrand Guay/AFP/Getty ImagesFor decades, the trusts’ web of companies have enabled Abramovich and his family to live the high life: from purchasing aircraft – a Boeing 787 Dreamliner and multiple Airbus helicopters – to paying the pop star Prince for a private concert in the Caribbean.But the timing of the sudden reorganisation of the trusts last February raises questions about whether the changes were designed to ensure his family could continue to benefit from his fortune and circumvent sanctions.Under US law, if a person subject to sanctions directly or indirectly owns 50% or more of an entity its assets can be frozen. UK and EU rules are similar but allow assets to be frozen when a person owns less than 50% of the entity if they exercise direct or indirect control over it.But establishing who really controls assets, particularly when they are held by opaque offshore trusts, is rarely a straightforward task, experts say.With Abramovich’s trusts, measures appear to have been taken that would enable him to state that he does not legally control the trusts’ assets. Files suggest he has been permanently prevented from exercising any control over the trusts as a trustee or protector.A former senior US sanctions enforcement official said the reorganisation of the trusts could be used as an effective way of distancing someone from assets vulnerable to being frozen as a result of sanctions.“It is often challenging to figure out ownership due to the byzantine ways assets are held through shell companies and trusts,” they said. “And then when you add further levels of abstraction with respect to who controls the assets, enforcement can become a very challenging exercise.”Challenges facing authoritiesIt remains unclear what impact, in practice, the reorganisation of the Abramovich trusts has had on sanctions enforcement, but there are indications authorities are facing challenges when tracing assets linked to the oligarch.In London, a £90m mansion on Kensington Palace Gardens that reportedly belongs to the former Chelsea football club owner has so far avoided a restriction notice that would prevent it from being sold without explicit permission from the UK’s sanctions enforcement agency.The Land Registry told the Guardian last year that some properties, even if publicly linked to a person subject to sanctions, may not be marked as restricted because of insufficient evidence of ownership, particularly where they are owned by anonymous trusts.The £90m mansion on Kensington Palace Gardens in west London that reportedly belongs to Roman Abramovich.

Documents suggest the Cyprus-based company owns the property on behalf of the KPG Trust – whose sole beneficiary, until February 2022, was Abramovich.Timeline showing the sequences of events.After the reorganisation, the oligarch’s entitlement to distributions from the trust’s assets was reduced to 49%, while his children were appointed as beneficiaries and granted a 51% entitlement.Documents suggest the same change was applied to at least seven of the 10 trusts, including: the Grano Trust, Zeus Trust, Zephros Trust, Proteus Trust and Perseus Trust. The children were also appointed as beneficiaries of the Sara Trust but the proportion of their entitlement to its assets is unclear. Abramovich’s beneficial interest in the Ermis Trust was reduced to 49%.As a result of the reorganisation, other assets in the sights of authorities may prove more challenging to tie back to Abramovich.Last month, the Canadian government said it planned to seize $26m in assets in the country held by Granite Capital Holdings, a British Virgin Islands company, which it said was owned by Abramovich. If successfully seized, officials said, the proceeds would be used for the reconstruction of Ukraine.But documents indicate Granite Capital Holdings is no longer owned by Abramovich. The files suggest he was removed in February 2022 as a beneficiary of the HF Trust that ultimately holds the BVI company.He was then replaced by his children, though in March 2022, shortly before the UK and EU imposed sanctions on Abramovich, the trustees of the HF Trust told a Cayman Islands-based hedge fund administrator that the children held no fixed interest in the trust’s assets and any distribution of its funds were made at the trustee’s discretion.Financial statements in the leaked cache suggest that at the end of 2019 the trust held assets worth $3.3bn.Documents suggest that in February 2022 Abramovich was removed as a beneficiary of a trust that holds a British Virgin Islands-based company responsible for $26m in assets held in Canada. Photograph: Walter Bibikow/Getty ImagesDavid Rundle, a sanctions and financial crime lawyer at WilmerHale, said the reorganisation of a trust, in anticipation of a connected person being subject to financial sanctions, could protect against the property being frozen but it was not a “silver bullet”.He said where the children of a person subject to sanctions became beneficiaries shortly before sanctions were imposed, financial institutions were likely to be extremely cautious about how they treat the assets, unless they were satisfied the individual subject to sanctions no longer had effective control over them. “Subject to evidence of estrangement, that is not an easy standard to meet,” he said.Additional reporting and engineering support from Sam Cutler and Mario Savarese"
7,"Russia-Ukraine war  Putin preparing to mobilise extra 500,000 conscripts, claims Kyiv Putin preparing to mobilise extra 500,000 conscripts, claims Kyiv",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/06/russia-preparing-mobilise-extra-500000-conscripts-claims-ukraine,"Ukraine’s military intelligence has claimed that Russia is set to order the mobilisation of as many as 500,000 conscripts in January in addition to the 300,000 it called up in October, in another apparent sign that Vladimir Putin has no intention of ending the war.Vadym Skibitsky, Ukraine’s deputy military intelligence chief, said Ukraine believed the conscripts would be part of a string of Russian offensives over the spring and summer in the east and south of the country.Russia has denied it is preparing a second wave of mobilisation, with Putin saying last month it was “pointless” to talk about a new call-up, claiming that only half of those already mobilised had been sent to Ukraine.Russian officials, including Putin, previously denied plans to order a mobilisation before eventually declaring a “partial mobilisation” in September.Ukraine’s warning of a new mobilisation comes as Russia claims to have adhered to its unilateral ceasefire on Orthodox Christmas.The Russian defence ministry on Friday claimed its troops began observing a ceasefire from noon Moscow time “along the entire line of contact”. But, nevertheless, a fire station in Ukrainian-controlled Kherson was shelled, killing a firefighter and injuring four other people, according to Kherson’s regional administration.Meanwhile, fighting appeared to have continued across the contact line in the eastern Donetsk region.Citing witnesses in Russian-occupied regional capital Donetsk, Reuters reported outgoing artillery fire from Russian positions on the city’s outskirts after the truce was meant to take effect. Russia’s Tass agency reported that Ukrainian forces had shelled the city at noon.Denis Pushilin, the Russian-installed leader in Donetsk, on Thursday evening said Putin’s order only covered offensive operations and that his forces would hit back if fired upon.Hours prior to the announced ceasefire, Russian rockets hit a residential building in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk, damaging 14 homes, the mayor said, adding that there were no casualties.The Ukrainian estimate of troops set to be mobilised is higher than that in September, which proved widely unpopular and set off protests across Russia.If the estimate proves correct, Russia will have almost doubled its prewar force in the space of a few months. Ukraine’s military intelligence said 280,000 Russian ground troops were currently deployed against Ukraine.In the summer, Ukraine’s national security chief, Oleksii Danilov, said a million Ukrainians were gaining combat experience, although it is probable only a minority of this number are on active duty.Skibitsky said it would take Russia approximately two months to put together the military formations and any Russian success on the battlefield would depend on how well equipped and trained the Russians are. Much will also depend, he said, on the continued supply of western ammunition and weaponry to Ukraine in order to equip the new reserve units Ukraine is preparing.“If Russia loses this time around, then Putin will collapse,” said Skibitsky, describing the upcoming six to eight months as the last push. He said Ukraine expected the latest wave of mobilisation to be announced on 15 January, after Russia’s winter holiday period. “They are putting their emphasis on numbers of men and equipment and hoping to overwhelm our side.”Andrey Gurulyov, a retired Russian colonel general and Duma deputy, said on Wednesday there were “no reasons or conditions” for Moscow to announce a second mobilisation in the next six months.“Not everyone who was mobilised earlier has been sent to the battle,” Gurulyov told Russia media, referring to the tens of thousands of conscripts undergoing military training.Contradicting the official line, several pro-war nationalist bloggers who have gained influence in recent months have said Russia had no choice but to soon announce a new mobilisation drive.Igor Strelkov, a Russian ultra-nationalist commentator and former intelligence officer, predicted Moscow would announce a mobilisation next month.“There will be a second wave of mobilisation. We will be forced to carry out the second, and maybe the third wave. To win in Ukraine, we will need to call up at least another half a million soldiers,” Strelkov said, adding that the new mobilisation drive would be held in late February, on the anniversary of the start of the war.“We expect them to conduct offensives in Donetsk and Kharkiv regions, as well as possibly Zaporizhzhia but to defend in Kherson and Crimea. This is the number of men they will need for such a task,” said Skibitsky, explaining why they expect half a million to be mobilised.In December, Ukraine’s minister of defence, Oleksii Reznikov, and army commander, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said Russia would attack from Belarus again this coming February. Conversely, Ukraine’s military intelligence said they believed the possibility of an attack from Belarus was low.According to Skibitsky, Russia only has one division – of about 15,000 personnel – in Belarus. In February last year, it had 45,000 and was unsuccessful in taking Kyiv, even though Ukraine was underprepared, he said.Now, Ukraine’s northern defensive positions are strong and Ukraine was ready, said Skibitsky. The Guardian spent New Year’s Eve on the border in Ukraine’s north-eastern Sumy region where the local defence forces expressed the same opinion.“Of course, this could change if Belarus joins the war,” said Skibitsky. Belarus has a force of about 45,000.But even if Russia has the numbers, said the US military expert Rob Lee, it does not automatically mean that its units will be effective – leadership, ammunition and training are problems right now in the Russian army.It remains an open question as to how well Russia can integrate the newly mobilised forces as there has not been a comparative war in recent times, said Lee.“If you mobilise 500,000 guys those problems don’t go away, you just kind of have similar issues with just more manpower,” said Lee, noting that less well-trained troops were better for defending territory than offensive operations. To compensate for the heavy combat losses over 10 months of the war, Russia has also recruited tens of thousands of prisoners to fight as part of the private military group Wagner.On Thursday, the first inmates drafted by Wagner received their promised pardons after fighting for six months in Ukraine.

9,Martin Ravallion  Remembering the ‘superstar’ Australian economist who made poverty his life’s work Remembering the ‘superstar’ Australian economist who made poverty his life’s work,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/07/remembering-martin-ravallion-superstar-australian-economist-who-made-poverty-his-lifes-work,"Martin Ravallion, an Australian economist who devoted his career to fighting poverty, occasionally found his reputation preceded him to remote parts of the world.In 2016 the Dutch publication De Correspondent described a 2005 field trip Ravillion took to the southern Chinese province of Guizhou – one of the country’s poorest – where he asked the county statistician what approach he used to calculate how many people in the region were poor.“Martin’s method,” the official reportedly replied. Ravallion wondered if the number-cruncher knew he was lunching with the creator of the method of measuring poverty adopted around the world.“No, you’re putting me on!” the official responded. “You can’t be the Martin.”World’s poorest countries’ debt interest payments rise 35%, report saysRead moreRavallion, who died of prostate cancer in Washington DC on Christmas Eve, aged 70, was that Martin.Gaurav Datt, an economist at Monash University, says Ravallion’s career “deserves better celebration of an Australian who’s done some important things in the world”.Ravillion supervised Datt’s PhD at the Australian National University in 1985, and later worked with him at the World Bank.“[Ravallion] just had this relentless energy, completely unstoppable,” Datt says. “He was going gangbusters right to the end, and given the chance he would have kept going.”Other former colleagues at the World Bank have paid tribute to Ravallion as “one of the most influential figures” in the study of poverty and inequality. Those at the Center for Global Development, where Ravallion was a non-resident fellow, lauded an “exceptional poverty economist” with more than 370 publications cited at least 10 times. Google Scholar attributes to him more than 83,000 citations.Ravallion was perhaps best known for his work in identifying methods to measure poverty that enabled cross-nation comparisons. This work nudged the World Bank to set a poverty marker, initially at US$1 a day, in 1990. With a yardstick in place, the next job was to identify policies that best cut the numbers below that line.“Even though we made statements about poor people, we never thought about asking them what they were doing,” says Shanta Devarajan, who, like Ravallion, was a former acting chief economist at the World Bank. Both followed retirement from the development bank with teaching roles as professors at Georgetown University in DC.“Martin took on what was traditionally thought of as a very soft, touchy-feely subject, like poverty,” Devarajan says. “He showed it can be approached rigorously, empirically and with sensitivity. It’s that combination that made his contribution so important.”‘An intellectual superstar’Ravallion knew something of poverty himself, growing up on the northern beaches of Sydney with his single mother. Friends say he never made much of his straitened childhood although it very likely shaped his outlook.“The idea that we care about the poorest has deep roots in moral philosophy, social policy and thinking about development goals,” Ravallion told World Bank bloggers in 2019.Martin Ravallion speaks at the 2011 Annual Bank Conference on Development Economies at the OECD headquarters in Paris. Photograph: Michael DeanPatricia Apps, an economics professor at the University of Sydney, met Ravallion when he was studying architecture as an undergraduate in the 1980s. Then a lecturer, Apps was influential in steering the outstanding student to economics.“He had such an interest in learning, knowing how the world worked,” Apps says.Ravallion was so able to distill complex ideas she invited him to give lectures before he headed off to the London School of Economics for a PhD.Apps would later stay in DC with Ravallion and his partner, Dominique van de Walle, an economist he met at LSE who also went on to serve as a senior World Bank economist with a focus on the poor.“[Ravallion] really saw what the problems were, could write them up, and he could also present them extremely well,” Apps says. “He focused on poverty across countries and, of course, the great inequality that exists across countries. So his work is extremely important.”Vijayendra Rao, a lead economist in the World Bank’s Development Research Group, reported to Ravallion, sharing an adjacent office, for a decade. He recalls a boss “always on the side of his staff”, who would walk in to seek an opinion on his latest paper and happily brainstorm others’ work.People “would sometimes joke that he writes more than we read”, Rao says. While Ravallion helped make China’s rapid poverty reduction better known to the world, it was his knowledge and “great affection” for India that stood out.“He had read all these obscure papers that I thought only I had read,” Rao says. “[Ravallion] knew as much about the intellectual life of India, particularly around issues of poverty and poverty management, as any Indian economist would have.”Justin Sandefur, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, says Ravallion “was really agnostic about the politics”.“He would have said, ‘you know, an argument about nationalisation or privatisation of state enterprises, that’s beyond my remit’,” Sandefur says. “What I’m here to tell you is what impact it’s having on poverty.”Ravallion was “probably not a household name” in Australia or elsewhere, but within the World Bank, with its thousands of economists, he was “an intellectual superstar” whose influence lives on, Sandefur says.When the institution set its mission to a “world free of poverty”, it was “Martin’s definition and Martin’s measure”, Sandefur says."

Many were struggling to cope after seeing their property, livestock and even parts of their houses swept away.“People are traumatised and angry, they’re displaced … many people have lost everything, the basics of their homes, fridges, air conditioning, stoves, bedding, personal things and photos,” Ross told Guardian Australia. “It’s an absolute disaster.”His home was one of many to be flooded, and it could take two months to be livable again. “It will probably be at least six to eight weeks [for all flooded houses to be habitable],” Ross said. “Obviously they will need to be assessed and approved by the department of communities before people can move back in. These are all Aboriginal housing.”Ross said the stress of the extreme weather event had been compounded by a lack of communication with First Nations people.“In a place with 80-90% Aboriginal people, you would expect that they would convene talks with Aboriginal leaders to let them know what they are doing, but it’s practically nonexistent, it’s a total disregard,” he said.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundupThe Department of Fire and Emergency Services has sent in rescuers to evacuate the communities that are most at risk, as well as to deliver food and medical supplies via air and boat.The emergency services minister, Stephen Dawson, told reporters at a press conference in the Kimberley town of Broome on Friday that he understood people were feeling angry and distressed. “I understand frustrations from people,” Dawson said. “I’m frustrated too, as the community is too, because this weather event continues to go on and it has hampered our efforts to get people and supplies on the ground as quickly as we would have liked to.”He said authorities were working on getting more supplies out to people on stations and re-stocking food and local stores.The emergency services commissioner, Darren Klemm, said it was “the worst flood disaster in our state’s history”.Klemm said emergency services were working with traditional owners and community leaders “on a daily basis to share key information”, but stressed that the scale of the disaster was unprecedented.Mud that’s smelly, dusty, and sets like concreteAs the flood waters slowly began to recede, locals started tosift through the damage.

But he returned home a few hours later.Flood water in Geoff Davis’s Fitzroy Crossing home.

Rectifying that might not be easy so I have no idea what the cost of that is.”He is already dreading dealing with the mud. The rains have let up, but the heat is expected to soar to 35C over the next few days. “The problem is when it dries out, which it will do when the river goes down, it gets smelly first and then it gets dusty,” he said. “And then it becomes like concrete and it’s extremely hard to move.“It’s not a pleasant place to be when you’ve got stinking mud, dead animals and that hot with no air conditioning.”Davis said he has been buoyed up by the support of family and friends – many of whom have also lost everything. “There’s a few challenges in front of us, but there’s been some fantastic people offering help and moral support,” he said. “But at the moment, it’s working out what the problems are because still a lot of it is hidden underneath either water or mud.”"
11,    Reasons for pre-flight tests on China are now clear but home Covid strategies remain murky              Paul Karp            Reasons for pre-flight tests on China are now clear but home Covid strategies remain murky,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/07/reasons-for-pre-flight-tests-on-china-are-now-clear-but-home-covid-strategies-remain-murky,"When is imposing a pre-flight Covid test requirement on travellers from China against medical advice not a breach of a commitment to follow that advice? When it’s done out of an “abundance of caution”, enough other countries are doing it and it might help squeeze China for more information about its Covid outbreak, apparently.Those were the explanations the health minister, Mark Butler, offered throughout the week.Although the requirement itself for a negative Covid test in the 48 hours prior to departure may not be onerous, it was still a surprise to see such a break from the “follow the medical advice” mantra of the first two years of the pandemic.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsTo understand how we got here, perhaps it’s best if we start with the government’s messaging last week, when the chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, publicly observed there was no need for pre-flight tests because Australia already had the variant circulating in China.On Thursday 29 December, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, told ABC News Breakfast the government would “take the appropriate advice from the health experts and follow that advice”.There’s more pressure from constituents ‘to screen Chinese travellers’ than there is not to discriminate against ChinaIt sounded pretty definitive, but he added: “Our priority is to keep Australians as safe as possible.”Butler then announced on Sunday that Australia would impose pre-flight tests, leading some stakeholders, including Universities Australia and the Tourism and Transport Forum, to back the government, apparently on the assumption this is what advice recommended.In fact, in the advice written on 31 December and published after Butler’s press conference, Kelly said that he did “not believe that there is sufficient public health rationale” for any additional requirements, labelling any restriction on travel from China “disproportionate to the risk”.Butler’s justification was that pre-flight tests were being imposed “out of an abundance of caution”, essentially arguing that it was above and beyond what was recommended.The problem with Butler’s “abundance of caution” and Albanese’s keeping “as safe as possible” is that many public health experts, including Prof Julie Leask and the Australian Medical Association, noted we don’t seem to be taking the same approach with our own outbreak in Australia.After two years of harsh policies including border closures and lockdowns gave Australia world-beating health results, 2022 was the deadliest year, with more than 14,000 Covid deaths.The seven-day average for deaths per day is currently 21 and that’s mid-summer in Australia.While almost nobody is calling for a return to the most restrictive policies, the AMA president, Steve Robson, called for a “comprehensive strategy” – which could include better ventilation and measures like mask-wearing on public transport – rather than what appears to be “a series of political responses”.The pre-flight testing regime seemed to be full of political risks for the government, including criticism from the opposition for abandoning advice and imperilling the fragile relationship with China.But the government has calculated that the risk is actually very low.Sign up to Five Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

The world should be watching – and testing | Devi SridharRead moreHe continued to put a significant gloss on the advice by stating he had “accepted every positive recommendation” in it, measures to improve surveillance like wastewater testing.Then, the real reason: “I’ve asked my department to reach out to their equivalents in China, to stress our view that it would be valuable for information to be shared more comprehensively by China not just with Australia but with the rest of the world.“Real-time uploading of their genomic sequencing of Covid cases – this is what governments, including Australia, are calling for. This is why we’ve put in place these modest, sensible measures out of an abundance of caution.”It’s good we now know why we’re testing travellers from China, but the government could be clearer on whether there’s any more we could be doing to deal with Covid at home."
12,AI  New York City schools ban chatbot that writes essays and answers prompts New York City schools ban chatbot that writes essays and answers prompts,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/06/new-york-city-schools-ban-ai-chatbot-chatgpt,"New York City schools have banned ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence chatbot that generates human-like writing including essays, amid fears that students could use it to cheat.According to the city’s education department, the tool will be forbidden across all devices and networks in New York’s public schools. Jenna Lyle, a department spokesperson, said the decision stems from “concerns about negative impacts on student learning, and concerns regarding the safety and accuracy of contents”.ChatGPT was created by OpenAI, an independent artificial intelligence research foundation co-founded by Elon Musk in 2015. Released last November, OpenAI’s chatbot is able to create stunningly human-like responses to a wide range of questions and various writing prompts. ChatGPT is trained on a large sample of text taken from the internet and interacts with users in a dialogue format.According to OpenAI, the conversation format allows ChatGPT “to answer follow-up questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests”. Users can request rephrasings, summaries and expansions on the texts that it churns out.The decision to ban the chatbot in New York schools comes amid widespread fears that it could encourage students to plagiarize.“While the tool may be able to provide quick and easy answers to questions, it does not build critical-thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for academic and lifelong success,” Lyle said.Nevertheless, individual schools are still able to request access to ChatPGT for “purposes of AI and technology-related education”, she added.Since New York’s announcement, OpenAI has tried to reassure teachers. The company told the Washington Post: “We don’t want ChatGPT to be used for misleading purposes in schools or anywhere else, so we’re already developing mitigations to help anyone identify text generated by that system.“We look forward to working with educators on useful solutions, and other ways to help teachers and students benefit from artificial intelligence,” it added.Last month, OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, tweeted that ChatGPT is “incredibly limited, but good enough at some things to create a misleading impression of greatness”.“It’s a mistake to be relying on it for anything important right now. It’s a preview of progress; we have lots of work to do on robustness and truthfulness,” he said, adding, “Fun, creative inspiration; great! Reliance for factual queries; not such a good idea.”The chatbot has so far proved to be divisive among educators.“The robots are here and they’re going to be doing our students’ homework,” warned educator Dan Lewer on TikTok.Lewer advises teachers to ask students who submit their essays at home to also submit a “short and sweet” video response in which they “restate their thesis …review some of their best evidence, their best arguments, their reasoning and then at the end I would have them reflect … What did they learn from the essay … what did they struggle with, where did they think they grew.“This will help students develop better communication skills while helping you ensure they’re really learning the material,” said Lewer."
13, ‘He will always be stardust’  New Zealanders find connection with space burials New Zealanders find connection with space burials,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/06/he-will-always-be-stardust-new-zealanders-find-connection-with-space-burials,"On 19 January, Keryn Townsley will be hoping for a clear night sky. Her family will gather at their home in Wellington, New Zealand, to watch a live stream of a rocket launching in the US – a tradition they have observed many times in the past. But this time will be different. On board the rocket will be a small inscribed metal token holding a portion of ashes belonging to 14-year-old Remy – Townsley’s rocket-loving son – who died suddenly in 2020.His ashes will orbit Earth for up to 10 years, before crashing back through the atmosphere and burning up. “He will always be stardust up there and that has meaning for us,” Townsley says, of choosing to memorialise her son in what is known as a “space burial”.The idea is not a new one. The first launch of human remains into orbit was in 1992, when a Nasa space shuttle carried Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry’s ashes. Since then, a number of companies have sprung up to offer memorial spaceflights – including one for pets – but it is the first time a service has been offered in New Zealand, through a New Zealand-owned company, StardustMe.“I get that it wouldn’t be appropriate for some people and some might even think it sounds gimmicky,” Townsley says. “But we’re very plain, straight-talking folk and for us it wasn’t. When you lose someone, you have to find that connection for you and your family.”Townsley saw a story about StardustMe pop up on social media in November, with its plans to launch its inaugural memorial flight on 19 January, and felt “a real connection with the idea”.Her son’s interest in rockets was partly ignited by his uncle – Townsley’s brother – who lives in the US. During a family trip in 2015, the family watched a SpaceX Falcon 9 launch from the Kennedy Space Centre.“Remy was blown away by the scale and the size of the rockets and he came home with a deep and passionate interest in how rockets work.” Townsley says. “During a school programme – aged 9 or 10 – he developed a rocket propulsion system.“He sold some of his toys and bought a model rocket … When he turned 13, he joined the air cadets in Lower Hutt because he wanted to learn to fly.”Remy managed to take a couple of flights before he died in 2020. After his death, the family faced the difficulty of trying to find an interment option that felt appropriate for his age and his interests.“We as a family look at the stars anyway when we think about Remy, but [the space burial] adds an extra element. It seemed that that’s where he would want to be rather than stuck in the ground.”When Remy died there were still strict Covid restrictions on attendance numbers for funerals in New Zealand, Townsley says. She adds that with this memorial option, family members in Scotland and the US, and those who were not able to attend the funeral, will feel included.“It is a really challenging time after losing your child, but this year we wanted to do something that we felt was positive. I’ll be hoping for clear skies,” she says.StardustMe was thought up by longtime friends Stu Potter and Geoff Lamb one night when they were on a family holiday on New Zealand’s east coast – the home of the country’s emerging space sector.Stu Potter (left) and Geoff Lamb. Photograph: StardustMeSitting under a glittering night sky, Potter, a business consultant, and Lamb, who has a background in space engineering, started discussing how they could use the wasted space on rockets and how they could “close that gap between us as people on Earth and what’s going on around heads above us in space”, Potter says.When the pair embarked on their idea, they hadn’t realised that other services existed elsewhere. “We thought we could do it better, cheaper and with more care to what is important to us, more sustainably,” Lamb adds.It is also the first Māori-owned space company in the world. Potter, who is of Ngāti Awa descent, says the night sky plays an important role for Māori, including the belief that the souls of the dead are released into the sky at Matariki, to become stars.Tikanga (customary practices) for burial can differ from iwi (tribe) to iwi, but cremation – which is relatively uncommon among Māori – can raise questions. Potter says the company has considered questions of tikanga and has taken advice from kaumatua (elders), but that ultimately, the company has “offered families the opportunity to choose”. Potter also notes that a family’s tikanga wishes are upheld by the funeral directors who help the company establish a plan for each memorial.Lamb adds that the funeral directors set the company apart from other providers. “We don’t want it to be too tacky or Disneyland – it’s got to be done with the right care and respect,” Lamb says.Two of the company’s primary goals are to keep the service sustainable, which included not leaving anything behind in space and using rockets that were already scheduled to blast off, and making it affordable, Potter says. “We’ve worked hard to try to bring it down to NZ$3,000, or US$1,500, which is affordable for a lot more people.” By comparison, the US company Celestis Memorial Spaceflights’ services cost US$2,495- $12,500.StardustMe has paired with an Italian company that almost exclusively uses SpaceX rockets, due to their availability and affordability, Lamb says.The company launched the service in mid-November, and sold out the five spots on the inaugural flight within days. It is now taking inquiries for a second flight in May, with a view to sending more tokens into space.“It’s been very emotional working with those families,” Potter says. “I knew there was a need out there, but I didn’t know there was such a big need.”Karol Klimek, who died in 2017. Photograph: Kristof KlimekFor Kristof Klimek from Auckland, a space burial seemed like the perfect way to commemorate his father, Karol, who died in 2017, and was “enthusiastic and passionate about life and stardust.“Which is why I was so determined to be a part of this mission – to return some of him back into stardust, with the hopes that some of his atoms will be spread far and wide.”Klimek says his father was a “legend in his own right”. The gemologist and jewellery maker had been connected to a different kind of star-power – his clients ranged from Elton John and Rod Stewart to the Sultan of Brunei.Klimek was drawn to the idea that the family could track his father’s movement across the sky via an app, and when the satellite re-enters the atmosphere.“I never imagined in my life I would say: ‘I’m sending my dad into space,’” Klimek says. “I personally have more of a connection with facts than faith. So, for me, to truly know he’s up there ‘looking down on me’ is priceless.”"
14,‘Every day is like a party’  The Melbourne cafe where people with a disability set the tone The Melbourne cafe where people with a disability set the tone,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/07/every-day-is-like-a-party-the-melbourne-cafe-where-people-with-a-disability-set-the-tone,"As the hospitality industry continues to struggle with staff shortages, a cafe in Melbourne’s south-east seems to have the opposite problem: a growing waitlist of people wanting to join its team.All Things Equal operates like every other cafe on Carlisle Street in Balaclava, though about half of its staff – from the front-of-house to the kitchen – have a disability.The cafe’s mission, according to general manager Bianca Stern, is to show that people living with disability are not only “ready, willing and absolutely capable” to work but should also be fairly compensated.‘Who can’t remember their first job and the person who gave them their first chance?’ asks one of the cafe’s board members, Sam Herszberg. Photograph: Ellen Smith/The Guardian“There are hundreds of thousands of people with disabilities who are willing to work but they are too often overlooked,” Stern says.“I don’t think perhaps as a society we are educated enough to understand the benefits of employing someone with a disability or what they need to do to be an inclusive employer.“I’m hopeful we are slowly changing that.”All Things Equal is the brainchild of Jonathan Wenig, a partner at the Melbourne law firm Arnold Bloch Leibler. He was concerned about the challenges his daughter, who has special needs, would face finding meaningful employment after she finished school.Wenig set up a charity, created a board and raised almost $200,000 – from philanthropists and his own funds – to open the cafe in January 2021. Among those to join the board was the property entrepreneur Sam Herszberg.“Who can’t remember their first job and the person who gave them their first chance?” Herszberg says.Sam Herszberg (L) and Bianca Stern (R). ‘People with a disability really want a safe, inclusive space to socialise too,’ says Herszberg. Photograph: Ellen Smith/The Guardian“People with a disability deserve that same chance.”The cafe began with 12 staff with a disability but has since expanded to 25. They include Harley and Paul, who have been at All Things Equal since it opened and have become good friends.“I love it. I enjoy the work and it teaches me independent living and it makes me feel happy,” Paul says.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundupHe began in the kitchen but now works two days a week front-of-house, which involves serving customers, cleaning and making milkshakes, smoothies and toasties, though his favourite aspect of the job is the team work.Harley, who is also front-of-house, says he enjoys talking to the customers and revving up the kitchen team. He has become known for applauding both during his shifts.“Every day is like a party,” he says.There are about 60 people on a waitlist for a job at the cafe.“I hope business owners read that and think, ‘Oh, wow, I can also do something about this,’” Stern says.Still left outAlmost 2.1 million people with disability are of working age in Australia, but research has shown 93% of unemployed people aged 15 to 64 with a disability have faced difficulty finding employment.The unemployment rate for people with disability is more than double that of working-age people without disability and this has remain unchanged for decades. It’s a statistic the 2022 Australian of the Year, Dylan Alcott, cited several times as he made improving employment outcomes for people living with a disability a focus of his tenure.He told the disability royal commission in December people with disability “always get left out of [the] economic conversation because people think we can’t do anything”.Dylan Alcott, the 2022 Australian of the Year, says discrimination on the basis of disability ‘happens every day still’. Photograph: Mike Bowers/The GuardianAlcott recalled having a job interview cancelled when he was 19 because the employer found out he was a wheelchair user.“That happens every day still to so many people with disability and that sucks,” he said.Herszberg says for many young people with disability, a job at All Things Equal is the first time they have had paid work.All staff are paid the hospitality award rate – a marked contrast with other employers, including some Australian Disability Enterprises, which provide supported work to people with moderate to severe disabilities.The disability royal commission last year heard some people with disability were paid as little as $2.27 an hour at ADEs, compared with the national minimum wage of $20.33.The Disability Employment Service (DES), a $1bn-a-year government scheme that pays companies and non-profits to get people with disability into work, is also under review, having been described as ineffective.All Things Equal is not affiliated with either scheme. Its staff are required to follow a recruitment process that includes writing a CV and sitting an interview.Signs outside the All Things Equal cafe. Photograph: Ellen Smith/The GuardianThroughout the process, the cafe makes an effort to understand potential employees’ capabilities and their support requirements. This can entail providing a more accessible uniform, the implementation of visual resources, adapting shift and break times or splitting a staff member’s time between serving customers and kitchen work.It also offers in-house cooking lessons to people with a disability, and runs an ice-cream truck, a small cafe in an aged care facility in neighbouring Windsor, and a Sunday canteen at a junior football club in South Caulfield.It hopes to launch catering and events packages, as well as a social night.“Work is so important but one of the things we keep hearing is people with a disability really want a safe, inclusive space to socialise too,” Herzberg says."

He is unflappable and has a general nerd-dad demeanour but there has always been a slightly morbid streak of humour bubbling beneath the surface. One piece of advice he delivered when I was quite young has always encapsulated this to me. It goes as follows: “You might be right, but you’re still dead.”I’ve never really been sure if he meant it to be as much of a life lesson for me as it turned out to be. Originally it was a simple admonishment about looking both ways before crossing the road, even at traffic lights and zebra crossings: yes, cars are certainly meant to stop for pedestrians, but you don’t want to be at the messy centre of the exception to the rule. Perhaps it was simply the shock value of telling a four- or five-year-old about the prospect of their own death so candidly, but the phrase lodged itself in my brain and has since refused to get out.Why it’s wise to give people advice | Oliver BurkemanRead moreCertainly I was always careful about making sure there were no out-of-control vehicles headed towards the crosswalk whenever I was on my way to school, no matter what the lollipop person said. But, as I got older, the phrase’s influence began manifesting itself in ways less literal and more quasi-philosophical.It began to show up at school, in relationships, when I started part-time employment and in other places, besides. The essence of the phrase, as I began to understand it, was this: being “in the right” about something wasn’t the only thing to consider when making a decision.Looking back on it, it can feel a bit cynical; a sort of cold calculus of working out what the actual cost of winning any given argument actually was. Perhaps you were correct about some small point or the other – but was it really worth rubbing another person’s nose in it, and damaging that relationship? Sometimes it was and sometimes it wasn’t; but knowing that there should be considerations beyond simply whether I was right was a valuable lesson for a younger me.It’s hard to pinpoint a single, major time the advice applied; memory supplies a patchwork of smaller instances, minor shenanigans and tiny mischiefs. Was aggressively pursuing the righting of some schoolyard insult worth my time and effort? Was it worth fighting with a good friend over some trivial misunderstanding?Then, of course, sometimes I take in those considerations and do it anyway. Sometimes, as it turns out, it was worth ending a youthful friendship because of one-too-many toxic spats. It wasn’t just a spur-of-the-moment decision, however, but something I considered, mulled over, then accepted.Nowadays, as an adult, the lesson learned – to consider all vectors of a decision before embarking upon it – is so baked in, so instinctual as to not even require conscious thought. And yet, all of that said, I still always keep one eye out for speeding cars."
16,"Andrew Tate  Investigation that could bring down ‘king of toxic masculinity’              While young men continue to be taken in by Tate’s online playboy lifestyle, Romanian police carry out inquiries into alleged trafficking of female victims            Investigation that could bring down ‘king of toxic masculinity’",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/06/andrew-tate-investigation-could-bring-down-king-toxic-masculinity,"An 18-year-old dentistry student from Lebanon paces outside the fortified compound on the outskirts of Bucharest where Andrew Tate was arrested last week. Omais Hilal has seen posts claiming the 36-year-old has been freed after being detained as part of an investigation into human trafficking, organised crime and rape.The stories are false – typical, perhaps, of so much of the online chatter provoked by Tate. And Hilal, it appears, seems typical of the young men who have been taken in by his extreme brand of toxic masculinity, which has led domestic abuse charities to warn repeatedly about its radicalising effects, particularly on young boys.“I came to tell him that I love him,” says the softly spoken teenager who is studying at Bucharest’s prestigious Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy.Halil, like many of Tate’s millions of online followers, believes the British-American influencer and self-proclaimed misogynist has been arrested as part of a conspiracy for successfully “escaping the Matrix”.“The police had no reason to arrest him,” says the aspiring bodybuilder. “I want to be muscular and rich like Andrew but that doesn’t mean I’m a monster.” He points to the fleet of luxury cars parked inside Tate’s high-security compound, which includes a £300,000 Aston Martin Vanquish and an £80,000 Porsche 911 with personalised UK number plates beginning “T8”, before setting off.00:42Andrew Tate escorted by Romanian police officers after raid – videoTate, who was born in the US and grew up in Luton, Bedfordshire, after his British mother and American father divorced, has amassed a huge following among young men by presenting himself as a globetrotting, cigar-smoking, champagne-quaffing playboy. He flaunts his wealth in online posts and claims to be the world’s first trillionaire.The former professional kickboxer has been banned from various social media platforms for posting poisonous diatribes about women, including claims that women should “bear some responsibility” for being raped. But, despite the deep offensiveness of these remarks, that has not stopped his posts from being shared on YouTube and TikTok, where videos with #AndrewTate have been viewed more than 12.7bn times.And Tate has certainly not been arrested for attempting to escape “the Matrix”. He was taken into custody alongside his brother and business partner, Tristan, 34, and two Romanian women, Georgiana Naghel, 28, and Luana Radu, 32, on 29 December as part of an investigation into human trafficking, organised crime and rape. The maximum sentence for someone convicted of all three offences is 17 and a half years.The Tates deny the allegations and are next week expected to appeal against the decision to hold them in custody for 30 days while Romania’s directorate for investigating organised crime and terrorism (Diicot) continues its inquiries. Their lawyer, Eugen Vidineac, said: “I’m quite sure about the innocence of my clients. We appreciate there is no direct evidence against them.”Prosecutors have accused the brothers of employing the “loverboy method” to lure women from Europe and the US to Romania. They allege that the Tates duped women with declarations of love and promises of marriage before forcing them to produce pornographic videos for the adult subscription site OnlyFans and video-sharing site TikTok.Ramona Bolla, a Diicot prosecutor and spokesperson, said they had identified six alleged victims. “The women were forced to produce material on a daily basis, over extensive hours, and they had a schedule to follow,” she told the Guardian. “They were producing pornographic material using different objects while engaging with someone in a different location. They were also doing videos showing different parts of their body.A screengrab of an Andrew Tate video posted on Twitter in response to Greta Thunberg – the pizza box allegedly revealed his location to Romanian authorities.

The women who have been arrested were making sure the victims respected the programme. Every girl had to have material posted, they had targets, and had to follow the schedule. If not, they were sanctioned.”On Thursday, a Romanian broadcaster published a transcript of a conversation believed to be between Tate and one of his alleged victims, which reportedly forms part of the prosecution’s case.He is said to have seduced one alleged victim with messages saying: “You have to understand that once you’re mine, you’ll be mine for ever. A woman never leaves her man. I will be the last man in your life.”He later reportedly added: “Can you be loving enough to be a wife? To always be by my side, wherever I go? Talk to zero men besides me? Ride or die? You have to move to Romania with me, to keep an eye on you. You’re mine. Do not forget that. And act like it. We will be together soon.”Andrew Tate (centre) and his brother Tristan are escorted by police officers outside the directorate for investigating organised crime and terrorism in Bucharest after being detained for 24 hours. Photograph: Inquam Photos/Octav Ganea/ReutersIn a ruling published on Thursday, the Romanian judge, who approved the 30-day detention of the four defendants, said the transcripts corroborates the alleged victims’ account. The judge noted that the woman claimed that Tate promised they would live together but when she arrived in Romania he was out of the country. She was said to have been picked up from the airport by one of the female defendants who had paid for her plane ticket.“She [the defendant] told her that she would live with some girls who work for the defendant and his brother, who have accounts on [OnlyFans] and share the profits with the two,” the judge said.TikTok ‘still hosting toxic posts’ of banned influencer Andrew TateRead moreThe judge also commented on the defendants’ ability “to identify vulnerable persons and exploit their emotional needs, their need for affection, trust, stability, creating the impression of a close relationship and thus removing any suspicion.”The police investigation began last April after a 21-year-old American woman informed a relation in the US that she was being held against her will at a property close to Tate’s compound.The American embassy tipped off the Romanian police who raided the house and identified two alleged victims. Four more women have since been identified as alleged victims. Tate’s compound was also raided and the brothers were taken in for questioning and released. They denied the allegations.Both properties, and three others, were raided again last week. The day before the raid, Tate had made the headlines after becoming embroiled in a Twitter spat with the climate activist Greta Thunberg. Prosecutors said police seized 11 supercars, cash, weapons, luxury watches, cigars and booze during the searches.Tate’s compound is on a pitted road next to a cemetery in the Bucharest suburb of Pipera. It is the headquarters of “Hustler’s University”, Tate’s £40 a month online “school” that promotes get-rich-quick schemes and previously offered courses such as the “pimpin’ hoe degree”. In October, the school had 221,000 users, generating an estimated income of £9m, BuzzFeed News reported. A Romanian judiciary source said it is believed the brothers have also previously made money through slot-machine businesses in Romania.Sign up to The Guardian Headlines UKFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines emailed direct to you every week dayPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But they were good neighbours, very different from their characters on social media.”Less than 500 metres away, in a gated community of identikit salmon-coloured semi-detached homes called the American Village, is where the 21-year-old American woman was claimed to have been held captive last April. Police claim it is here that Tate’s alleged online sex operation was being run from.The house is reportedly currently occupied by a 22-year-old Ukrainian woman, Tate’s personal assistant, and two female Romanian TikTok performers. The Ukrainian woman told the Times that none of them were involved in pornography.Eugen Vidineac, the Tates’ lawyer, says there is no evidence against the two brothers. Photograph: Cosmin Enache/AFP/GettyWhen the Guardian visited the property on Wednesday, a young Romanian woman in pink silk lingerie answered the door, saying: “I can’t talk to you. I’m not going to talk to you.”A neighbour said: “We don’t know the girls or how many there. But there have been multiple girls over the last two to three years and they change a lot. One of the brothers, I’m not sure which one, has turned up in a Bentley and once in Lamborghini.“The rent here is €1,700 a month so it’s not cheap. It’s a large house, around 240 sq metres with at least three bedrooms. All the girls seem to speak English because we hear them talking on their phones in the garden. One girl appeared to have an American accent. We saw police raid the property on an afternoon last April and then we didn’t see that girl again.“It’s obvious to everyone the kind of work they’re doing. They seem to be working mostly at night as the house becomes really animated then. They are known as Tate’s girls by the kids in the neighbourhood because we know the kind of job they have.”The Romanian judge ruled that the defendants should be detained for 30 days because the prosecution case showed there was an “attitude of disregard towards women in general” and that they were “only perceived as a means of obtaining large profits in an easy way”.Many of Tate’s online followers believe he has been arrested as part of a conspiracy for successfully ‘escaping the Matrix’. Photograph: TikTokThe judge also noted that both brothers had no previous conviction but had faced police investigations in the UK. In fact, it was revealed this week that Tate moved to Romania while being investigated in the UK for an alleged rape and assault in 2015.Tate had found fame as a contestant on Channel 5’s Big Brother in 2016, but he was expelled from the show when producers were told by the police that they were investigating allegations of abuse against him, Vice World News reported.Tate was arrested on 18 July 2015 in relation to an allegation of assault, Hertfordshire constabulary said. While in police custody, he was further arrested on the same day on a separate allegation of rape and assault, a spokesperson added.The alleged victims told Vice that police took four years to pass their investigation to the Crown Prosecution Service, which declined to press charges after deciding in November 2019 there was no realistic prospect of a conviction.The alleged victim told Vice News: “I have been very frustrated by the British police and court system for a long time.”Tate denied the accusations via his lawyer, saying: “They [the alleged victims] wanted money because I fired them. The police understood after the investigation that I am innocent and the police found messages from the girls’ phones where they were talking between themselves and planning to lie about me.”Vidineac said the brothers claimed that spurned lovers had orchestrated the accusations in Romania out of spite. “It is because [the women] had the belief that they would be wives of the brothers,” he said. “These are exactly the words of Andrew: ‘It’s about jealousy’.” But he did have one point to add. “The number of followers is going up,” he remarked. “If it’s the attention from critics, it’s not a good feeling. But if we are talking about the supporters, it’s good for them.”"

In my defence, I never asked to be the spokesperson for a modern-day temperance movement. My breakup with booze was always meant to be a year-long personal experiment. It came after more than two decades of epic partying. The hangovers were starting to hit harder and last longer. It felt as if I was drowning in a drinking culture that used alcohol to celebrate, commiserate and commemorate. In the shadow of my 35th birthday, I decided it was time for a spell on dry land.I wasn’t prepared for what happened next – which is also, coincidentally, the question I’ve been asked most since the book about that journey came out 10 years ago. High Sobriety documented the triumphs and trials of my alcohol-free odyssey and examined the wider culture that had swept me and so many others up in a tide that felt impossible to swim against. Drinking was not only socially accepted, it was socially expected.Why do so many drug and alcohol addicts relapse? The answers are complex | Diane YoungRead moreAt the end of that tumultuous, revelatory, and ultimately rewarding year, I tentatively went back to drinking. It was a decision that disappointed many readers who felt personally invested in my story. Some were downright furious. There was a quiet panic in their emails: How could you have so many revelations about alcohol and welcome it back like a toxic friend? How do you drink now? Have you mastered moderation?It was unsettling to realise so many strangers had tied their relationship with alcohol to mine. The pressure was intense. People approached me in bars, an eyebrow raised towards my glass of wine as they asked: “Didn’t you write a book about sobriety?”. It felt as if they wanted my story to have a neat, redemptive ending that offered hope for their own salvation. Life is rarely that simple.But as the years progressed, old habits crept back in For a while, I was doing a pretty good job at moderation. I was a more mindful drinker. Alcohol was something I enjoyed sparingly, not something I used as an anaesthetic to numb difficult emotions. I could happily take part in social occasions without a glass of liquid confidence.But as the years progressed, old habits crept back in – something I’ve since discovered is fairly common for many who try their hand at moderation after a lifetime of excess. Alcohol by its very chemical makeup will always leave us craving more.Jill Stark, author of High Sobriety and Higher Sobriety.And with the return of my big nights on the lash, came those wretched hangovers.

I quit drinking on 28 June 2019 and haven’t had a drink since.Sobriety has been easier this time around, largely because so much has changed since I first gave it a crack. It was a lonely place to be back then. Some friends stopped inviting me to events and I soon realised they weren’t friends at all, merely drinking buddies.

We now have profitable alcohol-free bars, the “non-alc” drinks sector is Australia’s fastest-growing beverage category, and we’ve seen an explosion of online sober communities, podcasts, “quit lit” books, and even “conscious clubbing” dance parties celebrating alcohol-free living.While drinking is still the societal norm, the culture is evolving in ways I couldn’t have imagined. This is the sober curious age. And the most curious are young people. Many are choosing to drink less or to not drink at all, as a volatile world with an uncertain future makes them more health conscious and has them searching for a sense of control over their lives.AltThis trend can also be explained by the substantial makeover sobriety has undergone. While once viewed as a dull and friendless existence, it’s gradually being rebranded as a sexy, subversive and socially acceptable path. They say you can’t be what you can’t see. There were few sober role models when I first quit drinking. Now, influencers and public figures are taking to Instagram and TikTok to prove that life without alcohol can be a fun and fulfilling, rather than a sad consolation prize.The pandemic reminded us life is short … Why waste it being hungover?The pandemic also changed the way we drink. Alcohol sales soared during lockdowns. While that led to an increase in the number of Australians drinking to excess, and a tripling of calls to drug and alcohol helplines, it also forced many people to confront their relationship with alcohol. Drug and alcohol service providers told me that they were finding women in their 40s to 60s – those perhaps most affected by the juggling act of work, caring roles, home schooling and the domestic load – were among those increasingly drinking to alleviate stress. The subsequent boom in sobriety coaches has largely been led by women in this age bracket who have quit drinking and have lessons to share, turbo-charging a sober curious movement that was already on the march.Higher Sobriety. Photograph: Scribe PublicationsA seismic once-in-a-century event tends to concentrate the mind on the way you’re living. The pandemic reminded us life is short and you never know what’s around the corner. Why waste it being hungover?Sobriety does not remove your problems, it illuminates them. For me, that’s meant having the courage to confront difficult issues head on, rather than blurring them out with booze. It’s given me a clear-eyed view of myself that is empowering and liberating, allowing me to feel joy, strength and connection in a deeper way than I ever have.I can’t categorically say that I won’t drink again – if the last few years have taught us anything it’s that there are no cast-iron certainties. But I can’t see a future in which alcohol adds anything to my life. I’m still not the pin-up girl for sobriety, but I’ll always be grateful for where it’s taken me.Higher Sobriety: my years without booze by Jill Stark is published 10 January (Scribe $35)"
18,"‘Always having to look like a pop star is exhausting'  Kimbra on the ups and downs of fame                At just 21, the New Zealand musician became famous for her part in smash-hit song Somebody That I Used to Know. So what happened after?              Kimbra on the ups and downs of fame",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/07/kimbra-on-the-ups-and-downs-of-fame-always-having-to-look-like-a-pop-star-is-exhausting,"Lately, Kimbra has been thinking about her anxiety. It’s something she’s long struggled with but has begun to take more seriously as an adult. “I have a really challenging career, so sometimes I [feel like], why me? Then I’m like, well, it makes sense,” she says, her native Kiwi accent dulled by years of living in the US. “Any young woman who was thrown into the spotlight young, who has to think every day about how they appear, to be scrutinised, and has a lot of people putting money into their career – obviously, I’m going to be susceptible to anxiety.”Kimbra Lee Johnson, who you probably know mononymously, has been in the public eye for most of her life. She began performing and making music at 11 (see the adorable clip of her declaring “one day, I’d love to be a pop star” on a New Zealand children’s show). At 17, she signed a management deal with financing, part of a long game plan to get her ready to launch as an artist, “which is a huge privilege but fucking pressure as well”. By the time she was 21, she had achieved the sort of success most musicians can only dream of when she appeared on the 2011 Gotye hit Somebody That I Used to Know, which topped the charts in 23 countries, was awarded two Grammys and now ranks among the bestselling digital singles of all time. Her debut album, released soon after, went platinum in Australia and New Zealand and proved her flair for creating interesting, left-of-centre pop songs that are more Björk than Britney Spears.Now aged 32, Kimbra is preparing to share her fourth album, A Reckoning. It’s her first release as an independent artist, which feels significant given her early years as a major label darling. She got her childhood wish to become a pop star, but can now reflect on both the good and bad that it brought. The Hamilton-born artist loves performing and feels music is her purpose. But success has also meant challenge and sacrifice.‘I don’t like how narcissistic fame is. I spend so much time looking at myself; it’s really boring’ … Kimbra. Photograph: Cybele Malinowski/The Guardian“It’s a pretty lonely life,” Kimbra says, before sitting in one of the many long pauses she will take during our conversation, choosing her words carefully. “Not a lot of people can really understand the pressures that you’re under. And I think loneliness is responsible for a lot of things. When you’re lonely, then you get more in your head and then your mental health goes out [the window].”I don’t like the transactional part of fame, where I exist to be an accessory for your Instagram photoKimbraOf course, Kimbra couldn’t have known what she was signing up for when this all began. At 17, as soon as she finished high school, she relocated from New Zealand to Melbourne to begin work on her debut album, expanding on tracks she wrote when she was 15, including Settle Down and The Build Up. Suddenly, she went from a “pretty normal” teenager with lots of friends and hobbies to being alone in a new city, her life revolving around work. It was a difficult transition, but in 2010 the hard work paid off and she signed with Warner. The deal was brokered by her then-manager Mark Richardson, an industry veteran who had flown to Auckland to meet Kimbra and her parents after hearing a demo on her MySpace page.Richardson had put her in the studio with producer François Tétaz to work on the album. At the time, Tétaz was also working on the next album from singer-songwriter Wally de Backer, AKA Gotye. The pair asked Kimbra if she would be interested in singing on an offbeat, spacey Gotye song that they were trying to find the right guest vocalist for – Somebody That I Used to Know.“She laid that vocal down in her bedroom with Wally and the rest is history,” Richardson remembers. “It just blew up.”Suddenly, Kimbra was everywhere. Vows, the debut album the 21-year-old had been working on quietly for years, was released a month later. But the success of Somebody That I Used to Know was “challenging” for Kimbra, Richardson thinks.Ladyhawke: ‘I feel lucky to be alive and making music’Read more“It’s like a massive adrenaline shot,” he describes. They were in the process of developing Kimbra as an artist, which had been moving at a nice pace pre-Gotye. “And then the next minute, she’s on stage getting a Grammy from Prince … It’s difficult to handle that. Because suddenly you get given everything, rather than slowly, progressively, earning everything.”Kimbra wishes she could have enjoyed or even remembered that time more, instead of constantly thinking about the next thing. “But this is stuff that you don’t really know when you’re 20,” she says. She learned how nonstop touring and her “all-consuming” focus on music could disconnect her from friends, and that fame could be a double-edged sword.Gotye, Kimbra and Prince onstage during the 55th Grammy awards in 2013 in Los Angeles. Photograph: Kevin Winter/WireImage“I don’t like the transactional part of fame, where I exist to be an accessory for your Instagram photo. I don’t like feeling like a product. I don’t like having to uphold a fantasy all the time,” she lists. “The expectation of always having to look like a pop star is exhausting. And I don’t like how narcissistic fame is. I spend so much time looking at myself; it’s really boring – in the mirror, approving promo photos, making things on social media. There’s a self-absorbed part of fame where you have to always be on watch. It’s a price I’m willing to pay … I just wish it wasn’t so ‘me, me, me’. Because I truly mean it – it truly is boring to only think about yourself, and fame does that. It just creates an echo chamber.”By 2014, Kimbra pulled the brakes. She began to work on her second album, The Golden Echo, in Los Angeles. It was the turning point in her career. Richardson says the pressure was on from her label after Vows and the Gotye track to deliver a big follow-up album; a desire that was sometimes at odds with Kimbra’s own vision. “She was trying to push the bounds of music,” Richardson says. “She didn’t want to be moulded into the next Katy Perry.”Excited by her new access to artists whose work she’d long admired, Kimbra crammed the record with big ideas and big collaborations with the likes of John Legend, Daniel Johns and Thundercat. “There was no organic flow with it … and I think that it just got a bit lost, to be honest,” Richardson says.‘I want to make shit that’s going to matter when I die’ … Kimbra. Photograph: Cybele Malinowski/The GuardianThe Golden Echo divided critical opinion and did not replicate the commercial success of her debut. Kimbra was happy in her decision to “go weird” with the album, and is nonchalant about how it fared. “It probably wasn’t a smart commercial move, but, oh well. I like it,” she says.Richardson and Kimbra parted ways after that. She moved to New York and four years later she released her third album, Primal Heart. There were “always the hopes that I would have more pop success”, Kimbra says. But it didn’t chart well, and soon after she exited her record deal with Warner, feeling she and the label were no longer on the same page.“I was on a six-album deal and they wanted to extend it to eight albums and choose my next producer. Nope,” she says. “They want to sign SoundCloud rappers – it just wasn’t the right fit any more.”In the years since that split, Kimbra has been through an intense period of personal challenges that include the sudden death of her best friend, breakups and navigating New York during the apocalyptic early days of the pandemic. She had to confront the way she processes big, heavy emotions and the “scary stuff” that lives inside her, including the destructive ways she says her anxiety can sometimes manifest. She began thinking about the afterlife more, delved deeper into spirituality. All of this was poured into her fourth album – one that is sonically more pared back than her previous work, with plenty of darker, more introspective tracks, such as the haunting lead single Save Me. Writing it was a salve.“I’m just so grateful to God that I have music because I don’t know how else I would get out that tension, that chaos,” she says. “I have a lot of interior dialogues, and they’re not always kind.”When she’s at home in New York, Kimbra enjoys simple pleasures: yoga, painting watercolours, walking her dog and watching “shitty reality TV like everyone else”. And now she’s an independent artist, she feels “liberated” in her work; no longer having to deal with expectations from a label about how her music should sound.“I just want to make music I like,” she says. “I can’t go and sell something that I don’t believe in … I’m leaving behind a legacy. I want to make shit that’s going to matter when I die.”Aldous Harding: ‘I’m like the Jim Carrey of the indie world’Read moreHaving been through the major label machine and come out the other side, Kimbra sees positives and negatives. The music industry can be exploitative, patriarchal and “very shady in the way it’s set up”, she says. But she also knows she owes a lot of her success to people in the industry who believe in her. She has begun producing for other musicians – something that offers her a healthy sense of detachment – and wants to mentor more young female musicians.Looking back, “it’s crazy to think of how ambitious I was as a kid”, she says of those early days of her career when she threw her everything into music. But everything that happened along the way feels as though it was leading her here.“[Without it], I wouldn’t be able to help other young women through anxiety and the pressures of the music industry. I wouldn’t have all these things to offer. You know how if someone has been married to the same person all their life, and they’re trying to give you relationship advice – you’re like, well, you don’t really know,” she says. “So I wouldn’t change anything.”A Reckoning is out on 27 January. Kimbra is touring Europe throughout January, and North America in February and March"
19,Imagine the fabulous statues    It’s time for rural Australia to celebrate our LGBTQ+ pioneers                 Michael Burge              It’s time for rural Australia to celebrate our LGBTQ+ pioneers ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/07/its-time-for-rural-australia-to-celebrate-our-lgbtq-pioneers-imagine-the-fabulous-statues,"As a queer kid growing up in a very straight town in the New South Wales New England region during the 1970s, I endured the pushback against my unbridled enjoyment of everything from ABBA to Charlie’s Angels.Yet I still managed to foster a sense of belonging, because I had allies in my mother and grandmother, who told me we had an unassailable local pop-culture luminary on our team. Peter Allen, whose maraca-wielding, chart-topping hits blared out of the car radio on our long drives home, was from nearby Tenterfield. Once I realised I was not the only local boy who could shake his hips and wear bright colours, I abandoned any need to hide my enthusiasm at the school dance.Not ‘the only gay in the village’: Hay rolls out welcome mat for rainbow communityRead moreFour decades later when I returned to live in the region with my husband, both of us battle-scarred from equality campaigning, it was a delight to see Tenterfield announce an annual music festival in honour of Allen (1944-1992).It was high time. Allen acknowledged his home town in Tenterfield Saddler, the 1972 ballad with all the cockatoos, kangaroos and tragedy of the best bush poems. The track – a tribute to his grandfather, saddler George Woolnough – accelerated Allen’s songwriting career, which included two Grammy nominations and an Oscar.There could be no greater accolades for a country boy who performed multiple shows a week in pubs to support his family after his father’s suicide.I helped the festival organisers with media content in their first year. It should, given Allen’s fame, have been an easy task, but I watched as they struggled to secure sponsorship deals with leading rural brands, which throw money at other music festivals in the bush. More disappointing was the old scuttle that did the rounds, about how Allen had wanted to charge Tenterfield big money when the town invited him for a return performance in the early 1980s.Music writer Stephen MacLean investigated that claim in his 1996 biography of Allen, The Boy from Oz. The fee was only $11,000, which would have covered Allen’s expenses for band and equipment; but MacLean found “local gossip” had inflated that as high as $200,000. The show never happened.Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletterThe legacy of three-time Academy Award-winning costumier Orry-Kelly (1897-1964) fared much worse in his home town of Kiama on the NSW south coast.Kelly was barely mentioned in the dairy region’s history prior to a 2015 documentary about his life. He had spent his early years in the town, where his father was a tailor, before moving to Sydney and the US to become one of Hollywood’s great costume designers.Along the way, he had a relationship with English vaudeville performer Archie Leach, who would later change his name to Cary Grant.What Allen and Orry-Kelly had in common was that they lived full lives as gay men, long before homosexuality was decriminalised in Australia. They also faced untimely deaths that some consider self-inflicted. ‘I no longer question who I am’: they’re rural, trans and staying putRead moreIt seems the higher our rural LGBTQ+ pioneers fly, the harder many of us need to see them fall. The cheap shots at their reputations were designed to plough the brightest of the tall poppies into the dirt.MacLean’s investigation of Allen’s Tenterfield homecoming revealed that the antipathy between the town fathers and their most famous son was likely mutual, but that was no reason to malign anyone for 40 years, over moneys that were never spent.Despite the support of locals who celebrate Allen’s legacy, the pause button has been hit on his festival, silencing an ambitious program of platforming emerging rural musical talent. In 2017, Kiama remembered Orry-Kelly by renaming an outdoor theatre after him, although his childhood home was recently relocated to make way for a new building.This subtle erasure of regional diversity can damage the sense of belonging for LGBTQ+ residents, our families and allies.

The regional city chose to rise above the anonymous barb in the Times obituary that labelled Helpmann (1909-1986) a “homosexual of the proselytising kind”.Compare that with pioneering celebrity chef Bernard King (1934-2002). If he’s remembered anywhere in his home town of Maleny in rural Queensland, it’s not obvious.With World Pride Sydney just around the corner, there is just as much potential for generating lasting pride – and visitation – in the regions, by acknowledging the rural origins of LGBTQ+ public figures such as Cate McGregor, who hails from Toowoomba, Queensland; and Yorta Yorta woman Deborah Cheetham from Yuin country on the NSW south coast.Molly Meldrum and Portia de Rossi emerged from rural Victoria; Bob Brown from Oberon, NSW; Benjamin Law from Nambour, Queensland; and Hannah Gadsby from Smithton, Tasmania.The process has already started, but there are many more who would probably welcome invitations from country councils to participate in the burgeoning rural LGBTQ+ events calendar.A few bridges may need to be built, but making the effort could attract the support of LGBTQ+-friendly sponsors and outreach services that are bringing hope and validation to country communities.In Tenterfield Saddler, which has at its heart a search for belonging, Allen called on his grandfather to “turn your head” to see what’s down the road.Perhaps he was also asking the bush to see aspects of itself through new eyes?Apart from anything else, imagine how fabulous the statues will be.Michael Burge’s debut novel Tank Water (MidnightSun Publishing) explores the subject of gay-hate crimes in rural Australia Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletterJoin the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community"
20,Three things with The Huxleys  ‘That’s why I’m extra camp now – I’m making up for lost time’ ‘That’s why I’m extra camp now – I’m making up for lost time’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/07/three-things-with-the-huxleys-thats-why-im-extra-camp-now-im-making-up-for-lost-time,"The Huxleys might be Australia’s most eye-catching artists. Since 2014, they’ve been working across performance, visual art and entertainment to create, as they put it, “visual [assaults] of sparkle, surrealism and the absurd”. But before they started collaborating, Garrett and Will Huxley were partners in romance. Garrett took on Will’s surname some years ago in solidarity with the fight for gay marriage.Three things with Heather Ewart: ‘I take it with me wherever I go, even on holidays’Read moreFor their latest work, titled Bloodlines, The Huxleys honour the legendary queer figures lost to the HIV/Aids epidemic. Presented as part of Sydney festival and WorldPride, the exhibition utilises the duo’s skills in costume design, performance and photography to pay tribute to artists such as Leigh Bowery, Robert Mapplethorpe and Keith Haring. Bloodlines is open now and runs until 5 March at Carriageworks.Garrett Huxley was lucky enough to witness Bowery perform twice before his death in 1994. Years later, Garrett managed to acquire an original Bowery costume, which he now counts as his most prized possession. Here, in the first joint Three Things, The Huxleys share the stories of their most significant personal belongings.What I’d save from my house in a fireGarrett: A few years ago, I was lucky to win an original Leigh Bowery costume he made at an auction. When I was 17, I hightailed it out of the Gold Coast and went to London. It seemed like a world of possibilities, and I was fortunate enough to see Leigh Bowery perform at a nightclub called Kinky Gerlinky as well as with the Michael Clark dance company.Garrett’s Leigh Bowery costume: ‘His work’s incredible mix of beauty and horror attracted me.’His work’s incredible mix of beauty and horror attracted me. Being a shy and awkward kid, the thought of creating this larger-than-life artistic persona seemed a world away.At the time I didn’t realise I would end up on this magical and ridiculous artistic journey making art and costumes, inspired in part by Leigh Bowery. I guess you have to be careful who you idolise!Will: I have a framed Polaroid of my father next to my bed. It is a sun-kissed, faded piece of history – him as a young, happy, handsome man swimming off the rocks in Greece. I had a really complicated relationship with my dad and for many years we didn’t speak; he struggled with me being gay. I often stare at the Polaroid and wish I was able to meet the man in that image.We had started to fix our relationship a little before he died. It’s been 11 years and I often wonder if he was alive to see [where] I’ve ended up, if he would have found the joy that I have in it, and perhaps come to celebrate his son. Maybe I could see the same smile he has on his face in that Polaroid. ‘I wish I was able to meet the man in that image’: Will’s Polaroid of his father, framed next to his bed.My most useful objectWill and Garrett: Our record collection. When we met 16 years ago, we bonded instantly over music – our mutual love of Kate Bush, Grace Jones and David Bowie. Our first few awkward dates were us searching for vinyl records together. They were a lot cheaper and rarer at the time. It became a bonding ritual for us. We talked about being strange, isolated queer kids growing up on either sides of a sunburnt land – Garrett in the suburbs of the Gold Coast and Will in the suburbs of Perth – and how music was our salvation. Not having many friends, the covers of these albums were good company and a window into another world, exotic and liberating. A tiny selection of The Huxleys’ huge record collection, which keeps their creative juices flowing.Whenever we make art or dream up costumes and creations, we have music playing. We have close to 9,000 records all full of beautiful sounds and artworks.The item I most regret losingWill: Mine is a bit of a philosophical answer, but I regret losing time. The time I spent in fear, not being out and proud as a queer man. The nights I spent being afraid of who I was; years wasted struggling with things that ended up defining me and setting me free. I can never get that time back. I think that is why I’m extra queer and camp now – I’m making up for lost time.Garrett: My first memory. I was shopping with mum and she bought me a helium balloon. It was white with a cat’s face on it. I carried it with me the entire day, thinking of it more as a friend than an object. All my soft toys were referred to as friends – I was very popular in the stuffed toy world.It was sunset and my hand was cramped, so I went through the motions of tying my balloon to a post. Except I had no idea how to tie a knot and I watched my new friend vanish into the distance. I became obsessed and asked any adult I could find where my new friend had gone to – living in the clouds, the North Pole, or maybe the moon. I even started digging a hole in my back garden to get to the other side of the earth in search of them. It was a big deal."

Eighty thousand litres of sand, piled 5-7cm deep, has been dumped into the ornate interior of the heritage-listed Town Hall, in one of the city’s most ambitious festival offerings.Sun & Sea might seem like the ultimate homegrown offering for an Australian summer festival. Opera singers – in swimmers – perform in the sand as children and dogs romp freely among them. Frisbees are thrown and volleyball nets are erected. But it has come from far away, from a country less known for its beach culture – Lithuania – where it premiered in 2017.‘I’m not afraid any more’: Christie Whelan Browne on Show People, Twitter trolls and her ‘horrible’ four yearsRead moreTwo years later the libretto was translated into English and presented at the Venice Biennale. It was a surprise hit, collecting the biennale’s highest award for country participation, the Golden Lion.“This year’s haunting, standout show is Lithuania’s beach full of doomed sunbathers,” the Guardian’s Adrian Searle wrote at the time, describing Sun & Sea as a “seductive performance … beautifully sung by the lounging tourists as we watch from our balcony, our ticket to the end of the world”.For it is an apocalyptic piece: beneath the protective sheen of suntan lotion, beach umbrellas and sunglasses, the cast of Sun & Sea reveal their mundane thoughts on a rapidly disintegrating planet: global destruction is happening around us while we’re busy doing other things – or nothing at all.Local extras are asked to frolic and lounge among the singers … Sun & Sea at Sydney Town Hall. Photograph: Bianca de Marchi/AAPTo some, an opera about the climate crisis might sound earnest, worthy and dull. But Sun & Sea appears to attract high praise wherever it goes: Germany, Greece, Norway, Switzerland, Denmark, Italy, Argentina, Sweden. When London’s Serpentine Galleries launched a coproduction in 2020, Time Out described it as a “heartbreakingly beautiful elegy for our relationship with the planet”. During its sold-out season at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the New York Times proclaimed Sun & Sea to be one of the greatest achievements in performance of the last 10 years.The opera is the second collaboration between a trio of Lithuanian creatives: composer Lina Lapelytė, librettist Vaiva Grainytė and director Rugilė Barzdžiukaitė.Their first collaboration, Have a Good Day, was an opera about consumerism, sung by 10 cashiers in a supermarket. It was so well-received that the three women were keen to work together again.‘The content remains the same but the setting also adds something to the meaning of it,’ says Rugilė Barzdžiukaitė. Photograph: Bianca de Marchi/AAPBarzdžiukaitė had been working on a documentary, Acid Forest, which told the bizarre true story of a dying forest in Lithuania that became a major tourist attraction. Telling the story of the destruction of an ecosystem through a wry creative lens appealed to her. Later, while attending a performance at New York’s Guggenheim Museum where the audience peered down from Frank Lloyd Wright’s iconic spiral staircase, she realised looking down from above was the perfect angle for humankind to observe its slow destruction.Sun & Sea has played in a baroque theatre in Rome, an abandoned swimming pool in Luckenwalde and a car factory in Philadelphia, but always with the performers in some form of sand-covered pit, beneath the audience. The Sydney production will cover the largest area for the opera to date, but the Town Hall is less tiered than other performance spaces where it has been staged.“The content remains the same but the setting also adds something to the meaning of it; it is always changing,” Barzdžiukaitė says.Locality plays a part in Sun & Sea wherever it is performed, with local extras asked to frolic and lounge among the singers, and bring their children and dogs. Performances have been challenged by barking canines and kids kicking sand into the mouths of divas launching into arias. The singers are already challenged enough by being compelled to sing in a prone position so the audience above can see their faces.“The spontaneity of it all makes it fun and unpredictable for the audience,” says Lapelytė. “But you do need a certain type of opera singer who is prepared to work outside that safe environment.”Sun & Sea plays at the Sydney festival until 8 January"
22,‘Moving ice can sound like it’s alive’  The musicians delving into Antarctica The musicians delving into Antarctica,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/07/moving-ice-can-sound-like-its-alive-the-musicians-delving-into-antarctica,"The Antarctic – the idea of it, the harsh reality of it – has fascinated humans for centuries. Artists have tried to conjure it. Explorers have tried to conquer it. Scientists and environmentalists are trying to save it.It’s a fascination we’re unlikely to overcome, librettist Tom Wright says, ahead of the Australian premiere of the new opera Antarctica, composed by Mary Finsterer for the Sydney Chamber Opera. It is one of two works about the great white continent at this year’s Sydney festival: alongside Wright and Finsterer’s avant garde opera is the experimental sound performance Polar Force. Both works attempt to draw audiences into the nature and existential crisis of the polar continent.Cruises, crowds and fragile ecosystems: the delicate dance of Antarctic tourismRead more“[The Antarctic is] not ours, it’s not for us, and so by way of analogy, it becomes either our hell or our heaven,” says Wright. “The Antarctic represents the limits to our knowledge and our pride. I like the idea of it being like a forbidden garden, a place we shouldn’t exploit, something to remind us that the world is not our oyster.”In Polar Force, audiences are drawn sonically and thermally into today’s Antarctic. “We’re cooling the space down to 17C, which is roughly what the temperature inside an Antarctic base station is,” says Speak Percussion’s artistic director, Eugene Ughetti, who performs Polar Force with sound artist/designer Philip Samartzis. “Then we slowly allow it to warm up during the performance. You won’t feel uncomfortable in any way, but you will experience climate change over the course of the hour.”Audiences will enter an inflatable structure, a bit like an igloo, erected in Carriageworks’ Track 12 space, and observe the performers engage in a “sonic dialogue” with field recordings made by Samartzis during his time as a resident artist with the Australian Antarctic Division in 2009-10 and 2015-16.Eugene Ughetti (left) says he ‘didn’t want to work with conventional musical instruments at all’ in Polar Force. Photograph: Bryony JacksonThe performance looks more like laboratory work than traditional music-making. Ughetti and Samartzis play bespoke machines and manipulate compressed air and water. The space is alive with the sounds of thawing permafrost, cracking ice, grinding glaciers.“Right from the start, I didn’t want to work with conventional musical instruments at all,” explains Ughetti. “They didn’t feel right for capturing a place where everybody is a scientist or a researcher of some kind.”The resulting sounds can be unfamiliar and unsettling. “Sometimes, moving ice can sound like something that’s alive,” says Ughetti.There will be recognisable sounds in the mix too – the anthropogenic racket that is the inevitable byproduct of exploration: diesel generators, transport planes, machine tools, trucks and transporters.Polar Force plugs into the present plight of the southernmost continent. Photograph: Bryony Jackson“It’s all part of the lived experience of the continent now,” says Ughetti. “That’s the message, I guess. That we can’t experience the Antarctic without having a physical impact on it. The more we want to be there, see it, feel it, the more fingerprints we leave on it.”That sense of a continent in peril is also present – though less obviously – in Wright and Finsterer’s opera, which occupies Carriageworks’ Bay 17. Antarctica had its world premiere in the Netherlands in 2022; Sydney festival is its Australian premiere.If Polar Force plugs into the present plight of the southernmost continent, then Antarctica taps into its past – that of a mysterious, semi-mythic place, a tabula rasa destined to become the last frontier of imperial ambition. The story begins with a cartographer discovering an ancient manuscript describing a great southern continent, who then persuades two other scientists to get aboard a ship and find it. Each of the three has their own reason for wishing to voyage into the unknown – about which none of them are being entirely honest.There are characters and plot, but we’re also creating a sense of what this enormous nautical and ice-based world without humans is likeTom WrightIt’s a story of pride and hubris, Wright explains, “a journeying of the human soul that ends with enveloping ice and snow and glaring light.”Polar Force is an intimate spectacle, while Antarctica is epic in every sense. Designer Elizabeth Gadsby’s set presents a towering 9-metre-high wall of LED screens pierced by a department-store-sized window, behind which the cast perform as if in a human fish tank. The five singers are like “ghosts in a milk-fog” inside that box, which is filled with a vocally safe haze.Singer Jane Sheldon says the show is “relentlessly challenging” for the performers. “Normally, we sing in the same acoustic space as the audience so singing the entire show inside this container is really, really strange for us,” she says. “We knew the stage design would be abstract and not realistic. I mean, how do you put Antarctica on stage? Whack a few icebergs on?”The Dutch contemporary classical ensemble Asko|Schönberg is arranged in full view of the audience. At times, the auditorium is flooded with clouds of coloured light that envelop the senses.‘That’s one of the messages of the piece – that there are places we just shouldn’t go,’ says Antarctica librettist Tom Wright. Photograph: Wendell Teodoro“We try to evoke a big conceptual imaginative seascape through this piece,” says Wright. “There are characters and plot, but we’re also creating a sense of what this enormous nautical and ice-based world without humans is like.”Human impact on the Antarctic, however, is unlikely to diminish in the near future. According to the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators , Antarctic tourism is booming. About 100,000 tourists – mostly aboard cruise ships – are expected to visit the shores of Antarctica in 2023, a doubling of the pre-pandemic numbers.“I talked to a scientist in the Antarctic Division in Hobart and he said the best thing the world could do with Antarctica would be to get out, pack up all of our rubbish and leave it alone,” says Wright. “I think that’s one of the messages of the piece – that there are places we just shouldn’t go. There’s more to this planet than just tourism or mining opportunities. There is something calming and eternal about that.”Antarctica and Polar Force play at the Sydney festival until 8 January."

On 24 February, when Russia invaded, there were only a few dozen professional soldiers in the north-eastern city, and they had no command centre. That evening, those 50 or so paratroopers were ordered to leave the city – about 20 miles (30km) from the Russian border – for another area. Most of the police force had already fled, along with much of the city’s leadership.Sumy’s residents were left, confused and in shock, to defend the city on their own as Russian forces rolled towards them. The Sumy self-defence forces – which formed for the most part on the first day of the invasion – managed to hold the city for almost six weeks, despite being encircled. After 6 April, the Russian forces were pushed out of Sumy region, and most of the self-defence force members then joined the army where they are now serving.Ukrainian soldiers celebrate New Year’s Eve at the frontline in Sumy region, Ukraine.

Russia’s defence ministry, in a rare admission on Monday, said 89 Russian soldiers died when Ukraine hit “a temporary deployment facility” with four US-supplied Himars missiles.Russia’s defence ministry blamed the use of mobile phones by its soldiers for the strike, sparking anger among relatives of the soldiers.Map showing location of Makiivka.Commenting on the attack, Lt Gen Sergei Sevryukov said in a video statement that a commission was working to investigate the circumstances of what had happened.“But it is already obvious that the main reason … was the turning on and massive use by personnel of mobile phones within reach of enemy weapons contrary to the ban,” he said, without providing evidence for the claim. Mourners voiced grief and anger at a rare public commemoration in Russia for the slain soldiers.Ukraine rejected Putin’s 36-hour ceasefireUkraine rejected calls from Vladimir Putin for a 36-hour ceasefire to mark Orthodox Christmas, saying there will be no truce until Russia removes its invading forces from occupied land. Pjotr Sauer reported this story.The Kremlin said Putin had ordered his defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, to introduce a temporary ceasefire along the entire line of contact in Ukraine for Orthodox Christmas from midday on Friday to midnight on Saturday.Many Orthodox Christians, including those living in Russia and Ukraine, celebrate Christmas on 6-7 January. Since the war began, some Ukrainians have chosen to celebrate Christmas according to the Gregorian calendar – use by most in the west – rather than the Julian calendar still used by the Russian Orthodox church.Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill during an Orthodox Easter service in Moscow.

Photograph: Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty ImagesWagner leader counts cost as Russia stalls in BakhmutThe head of the Russian Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said his fighters have sometimes spent weeks attempting to capture a single house in the contested Donbas city of Bakhmut, in the latest evidence of how far the Kremlin’s efforts there have stalled, Peter Beaumont and Pjotr Sauer reported.In a grim video released over new year, Prigozhin – a key ally of Putin – was filmed visiting a basement near the eastern front filled with the bodies of his fighters, many of them convicts, who had been killed during the bitter fighting for the city, a key Russian objective since the summer.In the makeshift morgue, Prigozhin is seen being shown bodies on stretchers and in body bags. One pile of bagged bodies can be seen stacked shoulder-high in the corner of one of the rooms.“Their contract has finished, they will go home next week,” Prigozhin can be heard saying, adding: “These are getting ready to be sent. We all work during New Year’s Eve. As more bodies are seen being taken off a truck, Prigozhin can be heard offering new year greetings.Zelenskiy and Putin signal desire to break deadlock in new yearThe city cemetery in Bakhmut, Ukraine on 20 December 2022. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesRussia’s war on Ukraine enters its second calendar year at a delicate point. It is six weeks after the liberation of Kherson and there has been little movement on the frontlines since then. There is not yet any sign of a full, renewed counteroffensive by the Ukrainians, not helped by the weather which has been above freezing, leaving muddy ground not conducive to military manoeuvre.“The situation is just stuck,” Ukraine’s head of military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, told the BBC last week, which, if an accurate assessment, is not helpful to Kyiv, which badly needs to retain momentum in the run-up to spring. But the political leadership of both countries has clearly signalled a desire to try to break the deadlock with new goals for the new year, Dan Sabbagh writes.Whatever Putin might say, the minimal progress in Bakhmut is one of a number of indications that Russia lacks offensive combat power. In a Ukrainian TV interview highlighted by the Institute for the Study of War, Budanov said Russia had gone from firing 60,000 shells a day to “19,000 to 20,000”.The boy who tried to escape war in Ukraine via RussiaDavid (who did not wish to give his last name) is one of many Ukrainian children believed to have been deported and sent to Russia unaccompanied. Photograph: InstagramOn 4 April, when his city was blockaded on all sides, 16-year-old David boarded a bus from Mariupol to Russia, Isobel Koshiw writes. When asked, he said he told the Russian soldiers exactly what he thought they wanted to hear, “I nodded my head and said ‘Yes, yes, I want to go to Russia’,” said David. “There was no option of going to Ukraine. I thought I’d get [to Russia] and get out quickly via Belarus.”But when David arrived at the bus’s destination, a city in western Russia, the local authorities sent him to a children’s home because he was under 18. They told him he would have to stay there until he came of age and took away his passport.David spent eight months living in a Russian children’s home and was only able to get out thanks to a huge effort by his former youth club leaders and a secret network of Russian volunteers, who have been operating in the shadows to help deported Ukrainians leave Russia.Debate over Banksy muralsA wide-ranging public discussion is taking place in Ukraine over what to do with seven street murals painted in November by the British artist Banksy on a series of destroyed buildings in and around Kyiv, Luke Harding reported.The conversation has grown urgent after thieves last month made off with one artwork from the town of Hostomel, about 15 miles (25km) outside the capital. It shows a woman in a gas mask and dressing gown holding a red fire extinguisher. She is standing next to a real flame-blackened window.Banksy painted the image and six others during an unpublicised trip to Ukraine. He later acknowledged in a video that they were his work, done “in solidarity” with the Ukrainian people. The Instagram post showed the artist at work – his identity obscured – as well as interviews with local people walking amid ruins.People look at the mural created by England-based street artist Banksy on the wall of the apartment building affected by the shelling in Irpin Photograph: Oleksandra Butova/Ukrinform/NurPhoto/REX/Shutterstock"
24,Analysis  Ukraine welcomes agile armour it hopes will give it a fighting edge              Light armoured vehicles arriving in Ukraine are good fit for tactics Kyiv has been deploying against Russia            Ukraine welcomes agile armour it hopes will give it a fighting edge,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/06/ukraine-welcomes-agile-armour-it-hopes-will-give-it-a-fighting-edge,"On the roads leading to Ukraine’s frontlines, a striking change has become visible in recent months.Where once the armoured vehicles being ferried in were familiar from the Soviet era – T-model tanks, BMPs and post-Soviet Ukrainian-built BTRs – they have in recent months been joined by a growing array of western-supplied vehicles.Bushmasters from Australia can be seen alongside Polish Dziks and British-made Spartans, soon to be joined by scores of even more impressive vehicles: US Bradley and German Marder infantry fighting vehicles and French AMX-10 tank destroyers.While Kyiv has been pushing hard for its allies to supply main battle banks, such as the US M1 Abrams and the German Leopard II, demands so far resisted, the armoured vehicles now pouring into Ukraine are in many ways a better fit for the kind of war and tactics that the Ukrainian military has been using against Russia.Faced with a shortage of armour at the beginning of the war, and – on paper, at least – heavily outgunned, Ukraine’s armed forces rapidly turned those shortcomings into advantages.Confronted with a lumbering Russian military approach that concentrated its heavy tanks and had a large reliance on recently upgraded Ukraine’s road system, Ukraine’s lighter forces have successfully emphasised speed and mobility – not least in Kyiv’s successful counteroffensives in both the east and south against Russian forces.Vehicles such as the French tank destroyers, sometimes called a “light tank”, are a good fit for the way Ukraine has been fighting despite not having the heavier armour and battlefield capabilities of a main battle tank.Equipped like the US Abrams M1, with a 105mmgun, the French AMX-10 is both faster (on road at least) and more agile than the M1. Crucially the French vehicle has almost twice the operational range of the US tank (800-100km compared with about 425km for the M1).The anticipated delivery of the US Bradley fighting vehicles will hugely bolster Ukraine’s mechanised infantry capabilities, which Kyiv has used highly effectively in its counteroffensives in Kharkiv, Donetsk and Kherson provinces last year.A shortage of such units, however, has meant that many of the same brigades have been moving from front to front to fight where needed.The Bradley’s armour and its main weapon, a 25mm chain gun paired with a lighter machine gun and a pair of TOW anti-tank missiles, make it a highly capable modern fighting vehicle that would be useful in supporting urban fighting in key cities such as Bakhmut, as well as more widely.Sign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wagner has played a key role in the Russian offensive against Bakhmut.There were indications that monetary motives were driving Russia’s and Prigozhin’s “obsession” with Bakhmut, the US official said.‘Every house a fortress’: Wagner leader counts cost as Russia stalls in BakhmutRead moreThe United States has previously accused Russian mercenaries of exploiting natural resources in Central African Republic, Mali, Sudan and elsewhere to help fund Moscow’s war in Ukraine – a charge Russia rejected as “anti-Russian rage”.In a video released over new year, Prigozhin was filmed visiting a basement near Bakhmut filled with the bodies of his fighters, many of them convicts, who had been killed during the bitter fighting for the city, a key Russian objective since the summer.Prigozhin has said his fighters have sometimes spent weeks attempting to capture a single house in Bakhmut.01:41Russia facing difficulties capturing Bakhmut, says Wagner leader on visit to frontline – videoLast month, Ukrainian troops fighting in the area told the Guardian that the eastern city lacked any obvious strategic value and questioned why Russia was so focused on what Prigozhin himself dubbed the “Bakhmut meat grinder”.“The only strategy I can see at this point is that they want to take the city so they can claim some kind of victory after a year that has seen so many losses,” said Sasha, a member of Ukraine’s 24th mechanised brigade.“We’ve noticed in the past two weeks an increase in shelling and infantry attacks as if they are in a rush to take Bakhmut. That also means that they are suffering ever greater losses. They are just throwing in meat.”Out of its force of nearly 50,000 mercenaries, Wagner has sustained more than 4,100 deaths and 10,000 wounded, including over 1,000 killed between late November and early December near Bakhmut, the US official said on Thursday.The White House said late last month that the Wagner Group took delivery of an arms shipment from North Korea to help bolster Russian forces in Ukraine, a sign of the group’s expanding role in the conflict.Reuters contributed to this report"
26,Heavy weapons  Germany signals shift on supply of tanks and armoured vehicles              Joe Biden and Olaf Scholz indicate shift in position on supplying heavier weapons to Kyiv to help in war against Russia            Germany signals shift on supply of tanks and armoured vehicles,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/05/germany-tanks-ukraine-russia-war,"Joe Biden and his German counterpart Olaf Scholz have agreed to send infantry fighting vehicles to help Ukraine fight Russia, a day after France said it would supply its own armoured vehicles to Kyiv in an attempt to create a breakthrough in the 10-month war.The joint announcement followed a phone call between Biden and Scholz and amounts to a step change in western military support for Ukraine, which has asked for up to 700 armoured vehicles to help force the Russians out.“The United States intends to supply Ukraine with Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, and Germany intends to provide Ukraine with Marder infantry fighting vehicles,” the White House said in a statement on Thursday. Ukraine has repeatedly said it needs 600 to 700 infantry fighting vehicles plus 300 tanks from from the west in order to give its military a chance of breaking through the increasingly fortified Russian positions along the frontline.Until now, however, the US and Germany have been wary of supplying Ukraine with Nato-standard armour, because they feared it would be interpreted by Russia as escalatory. But the decision to supply western armoured vehicles is significant, even if both countries stopped short of sending tanks.Germany will also supply Ukraine with a Patriot air defence system, in addition to one promised by the US last month, the White House added. Both countries will train the Ukrainian military on the Marders and Bradleys, although it it was not immediately clear how many of each would be supplied.Scholz’s deputy spoke up in support. “This is a good decision,” said Robert Habeck, the German vice-chancellor and economy minister, whose department has to green-light weapons exports.“Since the start of the war we have continuously expanded our support in coordination with our partners. It is only logical that we also take this step.“Ukraine has the right to defend itself against the Russian attack, and we have the duty to help her.”Ukrainian soldiers in Donetsk. Ukraine has long had its eye on western tanks to complement its reduced fleet of Soviet-designed T-64 and T-72s. Photograph: ReutersFrance said on Wednesday it was upping its military aid to Kyiv by supplying an unspecified number of AMX-10 RC light armoured vehicles capable, experts said, of scouting roles and supporting main battle tanks. Hours later Biden hinted the US was considering following with the Bradleys.Earlier on Thursday, senior German ministers indicated their country’s position was also evolving rapidly. Habeck, on a visit to the Norwegian capital, Oslo, said Germany’s position had never been “static” and that it would be influenced by France and the US’s willingness “to deliver lighter tanks”.The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, made similar comments. “I have pointed out time and time again we work with our partners to see what kind of military support is required by Ukraine,” she said after a meeting with her British counterpart, James Cleverly, in London. Cleverly himself said tanks “might well be” part of the next phase of weapons transfers.On Wednesday night, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Paris’s decision sent “a clear signal to all our other partners: there is no rational reason why Ukraine has not yet been supplied with western-type tanks”.00:36'No rational reason': Zelenskiy criticises allies' failure to send 'western-style tanks' – videoUkraine has long had its eye on western tanks and armour to complement its reduced fleet of Soviet-designed T-64 and T-72 tanks and BMP infantry vehicles, after more than 10 months of fighting.Kyiv has received about 200 post-Soviet tanks from eastern European countries since the start of the war, but the available supply in Europe is now limited.To replenish its stocks and build up a fresh attacking force, Ukraine has sought to obtain Leopard 2 tanks, or US-made M1A1 Abrams tanks, but its lobbying was unsuccessful last year.“Tanks are potentially decisive because there is no substitute if you want to attack enemy formations in defensive positions,” said Ben Barry, a former British army tank commander and land warfare analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies thinktank.Russia has largely sought to dig in since abandoning its exposed position in Kherson on the west side of the Dnipro River in November, as it tries to consolidate its occupation of a swathe of territory roughly the size of Portugal in the east and south of Ukraine.A breakthrough, if it comes at all, is likely to require the combined use of tanks, heavy armour and infantry, replicating a standard offensive tactic that dates back to the second world war. “The effectiveness of infantry is doubled, even with just three or four tanks helping,” Barry added.France’s six-wheeled AMX-10 RC were first deployed in the 1980s and have been used in multiple operations, from Afghanistan to Mali. They are in the process of being phased out by Paris, however, making them an ideal gift for Ukraine.An aide to France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said it was “the first time that western-designed tanks are supplied to the Ukrainian armed forces” but experts said the AMX-10 RC was too lightly armoured to be considered a proper tank.

27,"Cricket  Plenty of losers, but South Africa less unhappy after rain washes out day three of Sydney Test              Australia will have to rethink their strategy to force a win after persistent rain scrubbed the entire day of a Sydney Test yet again              Silly point or square leg? How well do you know a cricket field?    Silly point or square leg? How well do you know a cricket field?  Plenty of losers, but South Africa less unhappy after rain washes out day three of Sydney Test",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/06/plenty-of-losers-but-south-africa-less-unhappy-after-rain-washes-out-day-three-of-sydney-test,"In the end, the rain won. The entire third day of the third and final Test between Australia and South Africa was washed out, with play abandoned shortly before 4pm after rain finally stopped falling but left the ground too wet to drain in time. With Australia still in the first innings of the match at 475-4, the washout narrows their chances of forcing a win to whitewash the series, though a draw should still be enough for them qualify for the World Test Championship final in June. Remarkably, it didn’t wash out the McGrath Foundation, the breast cancer charity that has turned day three in Sydney into Pink Day as the centre of its annual fundraising push. A few years ago when the foundation mainly collected donations through volunteers at the match, a Pink Day washout would have meant hugely reduced returns. But the pandemic concept of selling “virtual seats” at an imaginary stadium has continued and prospered, and this year saved the day. More than 25,000 were sold to add more than $500,000 to the foundation’s funds, taking the overall the fundraising this year well past $3.3m. There were also donations from 23,915 people who came to the ground, many of whom stayed all day despite the weather. More than 10,000 pink bandanas were distributed by 280 volunteers, and the Jane McGrath high tea went ahead as planned.Silly point or square leg: how well do you know your way around a cricket field?Read moreCricket Australia won’t be as cheerful about the weather, needing to refund tickets for all of those attendees and the thousands more who looked at the sky and stayed at home. This comes after refunding two days’ worth of tickets after the fast-forward Brisbane Test that started this series. However, it was a great result for South Africa, getting through an entire day without conceding a run or losing a wicket. According to statistical analysts CricViz, it was the only day of this Test summer when the opposition’s percentage chance of losing the match did not increase. A day of rest would have been welcome too, mentally and physically, after two days in the field. For Australia, it will mean some tactical rethinking. It’s hard to win when the first innings is still going on day four. Usman Khawaja is not out on 195, and it would be rough not to give him at least a couple of overs to have a dash at his first Test double century. But that won’t be the focus. Speaking after play was abandoned, Khawaja said Australia would bat on initially regardless of his milestone.“Time is the only enemy,” was his formulation, which might seem counterintuitive to continuing to pile up runs. But a tactical consideration for Australia is to set a challenging follow-on mark, so they can aim to bowl out South Africa beneath it and send them back in. Declaring immediately would give South Africa a chance to top 275 and then make Australia bat a second time, or make a risky second declaration. As things stand, a dash towards 550 would set a follow-on mark of 350, and increase the chance of being able to enforce it.It would be a rare use of the follow-on if that came to pass, with most teams not choosing to enforce it in the modern era. This is mostly about preserving the well-being of bowlers rather than timidity based on historical results. When a captain can rest his bowlers in the third innings and then give the the final five sessions of a match to finish off the fourth, there is no reason not to do so. But when time is short, as it is here, the follow-on comes back into calculations.Two specialist spinners and three part-timers should help Australia bowl plenty of overs, on a pitch that has been getting damp, sitting under covers, and could do anything on the fourth day. The chance of a win is still very much there. South Africa could bat long enough to put that beyond reach. They still have their own chance to take something from the tour, and to follow their only good day so far with another of their own making."

After receiving medical treatment, the 20-year-old played one point before retiring in tears. Afterwards, Raducanu criticised the “slick” indoor courts they had been forced to compete on due to rain.Emma Raducanu criticises indoor courts after latest injury miseryRead moreShe will now go straight to Melbourne ahead of the Australian Open, the first grand slam tournament of the year, but is still awaiting conclusive test results on the severity of her ankle sprain.Raducanu and her team are hoping that she will be diagnosed with a grade 1 sprain, which would at least give her a chance of being ready to compete at the Australian Open, which begins on 16 January. If her ankle injury is more severe, however, her chances of competing in Melbourne would be remote.A year ago, Raducanu’s off-season was disrupted after testing positive for Covid-19 and then she suffered from blisters in her Australian Open second round loss to Danka Kovinic.Those opening weeks set the tone for a season filled with injury and health issues, ending with her withdrawal from the Billie Jean King Cup finals in Glasgow, and further complicating the task of following up her 2021 US Open victory.Sign up to The RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For much of a slow-burning encounter, part of the battle was to decode the schemes of the Manchester City manager.His most recognised left-back, João Cancelo? Pinned high on the right wing. The returning Kyle Walker? On the right of a defensive three. The midfield was flexible to the point of indecipherable. And for the opening 45 minutes, it did not work.Erling Haaland’s shadow display adds intrigue to Manchester City story | Barney RonayRead moreSo Guardiola twisted again, swapping Cancelo and Walker for Rico Lewis and Manuel Akanji at the start of the second half. City remained similarly set, broadly a 3-2-4-1 in possession, and they began to squeeze higher, to find their pass-and-move grooves. Then Guardiola twisted yet again. This time it was decisive.There were 60 minutes on the clock when he introduced Riyad Mahrez on the right and Jack Grealish on the left. It was a double substitution to highlight the riches at his disposal and one that surely turned Graham Potter a shade of green. The Chelsea manager had lost Raheem Sterling and Christian Pulisic to injuries in the early running, on the back of seeing Mason Mount ruled out with a training-ground knock. Potter can now count his senior absentees on all of his fingers and thumbs.Within three minutes Grealish teased over a low cross, Mahrez swooped to finish and City were on their way to cutting Arsenal’s lead at the top of the table to five points. It was a lovely team move, out to the right, then back over to the left, with Kevin De Bruyne prominent. Grealish’s assist was a beauty and the only question was why Kepa Arrizabalaga did not stick out a hand before it reached Mahrez. The ball had seemed to be there for the Chelsea goalkeeper.It was a big win for City – particularly after the frustration of their 1-1 home draw with Everton on New Year’s Eve – and it had been in doubt as Chelsea pushed in the first half. Yet it never seemed to be in the second half and certainly not after the goal.Potter had brought on Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang when Sterling limped off in the second minute but he would substitute the substitute as he chased the game. Hakim Ziyech was also hooked. Potter sent on the 19-year-old Omari Hutchinson for his debut on the right wing and the 18-year-old Lewis Hall at left-back, sticking with his 4-2-3-1 formation and simply rotating the personnel.The equaliser never looked on and Potter was left to reflect on another blow to Chelsea’s hopes of a top-four finish. The club have attacked the January transfer market, announcing the capture of another centre-half – Benoit Badiashile from Monaco for £33.6m – before the game. They also want to add the midfielder Enzo Fernández from Benfica and the winger Mykhailo Mudryk from Shakhtar Donetsk.Chelsea lose Christian Pulisic with an injury midway through the first half. Photograph: Tony Obrien/ReutersIt feels as though there are moving parts everywhere, a relatively new ownership group in a hurry to splash the cash and drive change quickly. But on the field, Potter’s team have taken just six points from an available 24. The table does not make for pretty reading. They are not only the fifth-placed team from the capital but the third from west London, behind Fulham and Brentford. Next up for them in the FA Cup on Sunday is an away game against City, who have already dumped them out of the Carabao Cup.Pulisic was hurt when the excellent John Stones stretched into a saving block challenge on him in the 17th minute. The winger was in after a nice Kai Havertz pass after a mix-up between Cancelo and Walker, and it was a bright first-half showing from Chelsea.Sign up to Football DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

City needed a Bernardo Silva tackle to snuff out Pulisic’s replacement, Carney Chukwuemeka, after a Havertz pull-back. And it was Chukwuemeka who so nearly broke the deadlock just before half-time. After another Havertz pass, he cut inside from the right and watched his shot beat Ederson, via a slight deflection, and rebound off a post.‘Now the gap is five’: Guardiola ‘satisfied’ after Manchester City’s win at ChelseaRead moreGuardiola had started with Phil Foden pinned high on the left and it seemed as though Rodri was the only vaguely fixed point in midfield. Then again, he sometimes dropped into the defensive line. It was strange to see City so disjointed in the first half. And yet when Erling Haaland is around, no defender can ever relax. Out of very little on 38 minutes he crackled to life, taking an Ilkay Gündogan pass with a fabulous first touch, veering away from Kalidou Koulibaly and unloading a shot in what felt like the same pre-programmed movement. The back-lift was minimal to give Koulibaly less chance to get across, Arrizabalaga less time to react. It whistled narrowly over.Guardiola was not happy at the interval. But his mood improved as Lewis and Akanji settled, the former tucking in alongside Rodri and also covering at right-back out of possession. Bernardo Silva went wide right. Nathan Aké headed against the crossbar from a De Bruyne cross after a short corner routine while Bernardo Silva beat the unconvincing Marc Cucurella to pull back for De Bruyne who blasted off target.Thiago Silva had lashed wide at the other end but it felt as though a City breakthrough was coming. They were enjoying more time on the ball and were getting in around the sides. Enter Mahrez and Grealish. Chelsea could not respond and Haaland almost added a second, narrowly failing to reach a low De Bruyne cross."
31,‘Who won the game?’  NFL star Damar Hamlin wakes after on-field collapse NFL star Damar Hamlin wakes after on-field collapse,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/06/who-won-the-game-nfl-star-damar-hamlin-wakes-after-on-field-collapse,"Buffalo Bills player Damar Hamlin is awake and able to communicate with his medical team after the NFL safety suffered cardiac arrest on the field during a Monday night game in Cincinnati, his doctors say.Two physicians caring for the 24-year-old told reporters on Thursday he was “demonstrating signs of good neurological recovery” and was able to communicate in writing.Hamlin remains on a ventilator in the intensive care unit at University of Cincinnati Medical Center to assist his breathing.Bills say Damar Hamlin has shown ‘remarkable improvement’ over past dayRead moreHe collapsed on the field after making a tackle in the first quarter of the game against the Cincinnati Bengals and had CPR performed on him while on the field.The physicians said Hamlin had asked in writing who won the game. Their response was “Damar, you won – you won the game of life,” said Dr Timothy Pritts.That he was asking about the outcome of the game showed “it’s not only that the lights are on – he’s home”, Pritts said. “It appears that all cylinders are firing within his brain, which is greatly gratifying.”Dr William Knight described the past three days as a long and difficult road. “He has been very sick and has made a fairly remarkable recovery.”The positive update was welcome news for the Bills, as they prepare for their final regular season contest on Sunday.An emotional Bills quarterback Josh Allen told reporters on Thursday about receiving word their teammate was awake and thinking of them.“His dad said the first thing he is going to ask when he wakes up is ask who won the game,” Allen said. “Sure enough that’s what he did.“As teammates you love hearing that response,” Allen continued. “The first thing on his mind wasn’t ‘poor me’, it was how are my teammates doing, did we win this game, and that’s powerful in itself.“We heard that news this morning and there was nothing that could have been told to us to bring our day down.”When tragedy hit Damar Hamlin, the NFL’s leadership vacuum came into focus | Melissa JacobsRead moreThe next milestone, doctors said, was getting Hamlin breathing completely on his own.They said it was too soon to say whether the hit or a preexisting condition caused Hamlin to go into cardiac arrest.Asked whether there was a possibility of him playing professional football again, Knight told reporters: “It’s entirely too early to have that conversation.”He said Hamlin was still critically ill and remained in the ICU, adding that the focus was on getting him off the ventilator “and on the road to recovery”.The doctors credited the Bills’ medical staff for quickly recognizing that Hamlin had no pulse and promptly administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation.“This went as well as something like this can go under very challenging circumstances and they did a fantastic job, which is why we’re here today,” Pritts said.The game, in which Cincinnati led 7-3, was postponed after the injury, and the league announced late on Thursday that it would not resume at all.The Bills were back on the practice field on Thursday preparing for their crucial regular season finale, where they host the New England Patriots.The Bills are battling the Bengals and Kansas City Chiefs for the top seed in the American Football Conference, which comes with a first-round playoff bye.“Yesterday Damar’s father spoke to the team and the message was the team needs to get back on focusing on the goals they had set for themselves,” said the Bills head coach, Sean McDermott. “I’m paraphrasing him but Damar would have wanted it that way and that includes our game against New England this week.”Football is violent. But the brotherhood shown for Damar Hamlin is why we play | RK RussellRead more“The news today was a big help getting us back focused on the game this weekend,” McDermott added.Fans, athletes, celebrities and politicians, including President Joe Biden, have all offered Hamlin their prayers and support.The NFL Players Association executive director, DeMaurice Smith, said he hoped this incident “sends a message” to fans and the NFL community.“Our men are not gladiators,” Smith said. “I hope ... that people are aware of the humanity of this game. And yes, it’s dangerous, and yes, it’s scary – yes, it’s entertainment.“But my hope is that people understand and appreciate the sheer humanity of this game.”"

A legend to us and to all of football. Rest in peace, Gianluca Vialli,” read a tweet from Chelsea on Friday after news of his death was confirmed by the Italian Football Federation. The club’s Supporters’ Trust (CST) described Vialli as a “foundational pillar” in ushering in a trophy-laden era at Stamford Bridge. “Even after his time at Chelsea, Gianluca was Chelsea through and through,” read a CST statement. “He was a frequent visitor to Stamford Bridge and he was loved by everyone at our football club.”Gianluca Vialli – a life in picturesRead moreVialli began his career at Cremonese, his hometown club, before starring in Serie A for Sampdoria and Juventus, and ended his playing career at Chelsea before going into management and coaching. He scored 16 goals in 59 appearances for Italy and featured in the Azzurri’s 1986 and 1990 World Cup squads.It was announced in recent weeks that Vialli would be stepping away from his role as delegation chief with the Italy team to focus on his treatment for pancreatic cancer. He had been reunited of late in the Italy setup with the head coach, Roberto Mancini, his former Sampdoria strike partner, and Vialli was hoping he would be able to resume his national-team role.Vialli announced he had undergone radiotherapy and chemotherapy in November 2018, having been diagnosed with cancer one year earlier. He was initially given the all-clear in April 2020, but in December 2021 he announced the disease had returned.An image of Gianluca Vialli is projected onto a building in Genoa. Photograph: Luca Zennaro/EPAExplaining his decision to suspend his Italy involvement, Vialli said on 14 December: “The goal is to use all my psycho-physical energies to help my body overcome this phase of the disease, in order to be able to face new adventures as soon as possible and share them with all of you.”Sampdoria wrote on Friday in an emotional article: “You gave us so much, we gave you so much: yes, it was love, reciprocal, infinite. A love that will not die today with you. We will continue to love and adore you because – as you well know – you are better than Pelé. And because, despite everything, our beautiful season is destined to never end.”They added: “We will remember you as a boy and a relentless centre-forward, because heroes are all young and beautiful and you, since that summer of 1984, have been our hero. Strong and beautiful, with that 9 printed on the back and the Italian flag sewn on the heart.”Gianluca Vialli spent his life winning trophies but he also won heartsRead moreGraeme Souness, who played alongside Vialli at Sampdoria, paid tribute to him on Sky Sports. A visibly emotional Souness said: “I can’t tell you how good a guy he was. Forget football, he was just a gorgeous soul. He was just a truly nice human being.“He was just fabulous to be around. He was such a fun-loving guy, full of mischief, wonderful footballer and a warm human being. People will say things about his magnificent football ability, and correctly so, but above all that what a human being. My condolence go to his family – the kids were blessed to have a dad like that, his wife was blessed to be married to a man like that.”The Italian football federation’s president, Gabriele Gravina, said: “Gianluca was a wonderful person and leaves an unfillable void, in the national team and in all those who appreciated his extraordinary human qualities.”"

35,"Analysis  Prince Harry book leaks let papers have their cake and eat it                Spanish bookshops and leak to the Guardian undo secrecy plans but won’t affect Spare’s sales, say industry experts              Prince Harry book leaks let papers have their cake and eat it",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/06/prince-harry-book-leaks-let-papers-have-their-cake-and-eat-it,"If Prince Harry’s publishers had their way, it seems the world would only learn about the contents of his autobiography when the book goes on sale next Tuesday.Instead, a leak to the Guardian and premature sales by Spanish bookstores have resulted in a flood of media coverage before a copy of Spare has even been sold in the UK or the US. Details of events including the prince losing his virginity behind a pub, him asking his father, King Charles, not to remarry, and his final visit to Queen Elizabeth II have been revealed.The wave of coverage began with Harry and Meghan’s Netflix docuseries, followed by some small hints dropped in some of last Sunday’s papers, and a series of short publicity clips from planned television interviews with Harry – all well before the Guardian published a short account from the book on Wednesday night, in which Harry alleged a physical attack by his brother, Prince William.Hours later journalists in Spain had clocked that copies of the book – retitled En la Sombra, or “In the Shadow” – had been accidentally put on sale in some bookshops. British newspapers phoned local reporters and freelancers, urging them to rapidly retranslate the book back into English in order to obtain more revelations – including Harry’s comments about killing 25 people while serving as a soldier in Afghanistan.Philip Jones, the editor of the industry publication the Bookseller, said that while publishers were officially opposed to leaks, they would be aware some extracts had piqued the public’s interest before publication.He said: “Lots of books come out with lots of pre-publication coverage and serialisations and it doesn’t seem to do any damage to sales. There’s always more in a book than the media can reproduce. If you’re a Harry fan or a Harry watcher you’re still going to want to read it in his own words.”Harry’s allegations are not just about a royal fistfight – but the very real dangers of hereditary power | Gaby HinsliffRead morePart of the issue is that Harry’s publishers appear to have decided not to sell the book’s serialisation rights, the process where a newspaper or magazine pays a fee to run excerpts in advance of publication. In part, this might be due to the lack of suitable outlets given Harry is currently in legal battles with the parent companies of the Sun, the Times, Daily Mail, Express, and Mirror. But it also left a void that was due to be filled by a handful of TV interviews.The early leaks allowed the newspapers who loathe Harry and Meghan to have their royal cake and eat it, writing dozens of stories about the prince’s claims while also decrying him for having the audacity to publish such material.The Daily Mail, whose parent company is fighting Prince Harry in court, described the book as the “excruciating” work of a “grudge-toting manbaby” – before urging readers to buy its print edition for 17 pages of coverage about what he had written. In an indicator of how they might fight their legal battles, the Mail also highlighted the juxtaposition between Harry writing a tell-all memoir and the legal cases he is bringing against British newspapers for invasion of privacy and phone hacking.Other outlets managed to move the story on, with the Daily Telegraph quoting a Taliban official demanding Harry is sent to an international court, after he wrote about killing individuals while serving as a helicopter pilot in Afghanistan.Jones said that in some ways it was impressive that the embargo lasted until just a few days before publication, given the sheer number of people involved in bringing the book to market, including the translators, the staff recording the Prince Harry-voiced audiobook, and the global book distribution network shipping hundreds of thousands of print copies around the world.Bookshops in the UK reported having to sign lengthy non-disclosure agreements with the publisher Transworld – part of Penguin Random House – which pledged not to put the book on sale before Tuesday.But Jones suggested the publishers may now be tempted to let Spare go on sale a few days early: “It’s not rocket science, the books will either be in bookshops now or in transit, so it’s not difficult for a publisher to say: ‘Go for it guys.’ Either way it’ll be next week’s bestseller.”"
36,"    After Brexit and Trump, rightwing populists cling to power – but the truth is they can’t govern                Jonathan Freedland                             The farcical scenes among US Republicans have echoes in our Tory party. Both promise disruption, then deliver exactly that, says Guardian columnist Jonathan Freedland              After Brexit and Trump, rightwing populists cling to power – but the truth is they can’t govern",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/06/brexit-trump-populists-power-us-republicans-tory-party,"The US right has this week been staging a clown show that has had liberals in that country and beyond pulling up a chair and breaking out the popcorn. There has been a karmic pleasure in watching the Republicans who won control of the House of Representatives struggle to complete the most basic piece of business – the election of a speaker – but it’s also been instructive, and not only to Americans. For it has confirmed the dirty little secret of that strain of rightwing populist politics that revels in what it calls disruption: it always ends in bitter factional fighting, chaos and paralysis. We in Britain should know, because Brexit has gone the exact same way.Start with the karma that saw House Republicans gather two years to the day since they sought to prevent the peaceful transfer of power from one party to another: often overlooked in the anniversary recollections of 6 January 2021 is that, mere hours after rioters had stormed the US Capitol, a majority of Republican House members voted to do precisely as the rioters had demanded and overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Yet here were those same House Republicans on 6 January 2023, having prevented the smooth transfer of power from one party to another – except this time, the party they were thwarting was their own.House still without speaker as McCarthy pleads with Republican holdouts – liveRead moreIt should have been straightforward. Republicans won a narrow majority in the House in November, which gave them the right to put one of their number in the speaker’s chair. The trouble was, while most backed Kevin McCarthy, about 20 rebels did not. By Thursday night, they had gone through 11 rounds of voting – the most since the civil war era – without McCarthy or anyone else winning a majority. The result: deadlock.It was a study in incompetence. A party asks the electorate to give them power; they get it and then freeze, unable to take even the first step towards using it. There’s no clear political logic to the stalemate. The rebels are devotees of Donald Trump, but McCarthy himself is a tireless Trump sycophant – patronised by the former president as “my Kevin” – who begged for and won the backing of the orange one. The pro-Trump rebels are divided among themselves: one rebuked Trump for sticking with McCarthy, while another voted to make Trump himself speaker.It’s telling that the rebels’ demands are not on policy but on procedure, seeking rule changes or committee seats that would give them more power. Otherwise, they can’t really say what they want. They succeeded in getting metal detectors removed from the entrance to the chamber, so now people can walk on to the floor of the House carrying a gun, but apart from that, and their hunger to start investigating Democrats, including Joe Biden’s son Hunter, nothing.All this has significance for the year ahead in US politics. For one thing, it’s yet more evidence of the diminishing strength of Trump among Republican leaders, if not yet among the party faithful. For another, if Republicans cannot make a relatively easy decision like this one, how are they going to make the tough but necessary choices that are coming – such as authorising the spending, and debt, required to keep the US government functioning?Prime Minister Rishi Sunak speaking during prime minister’s questions, Wednesday 30 November. Photograph: UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor/PABut its meaning goes far wider. For what’s been on display this week, in especially florid form, is a strain of politics that has infected many democracies, including our own. Its key feature is its delight in disruption, in promising to upend the system. That was the thrust of the twin movements of 2016, Trump and Brexit. Both promised to sweep away the elites, the experts, the orthodoxy – whether in Washington DC or Brussels. They were new movements, but they were drawing on deep roots. Four decades ago both Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher cast themselves as radicals daring to shake off the dead hand of the government.So we can hardly be surprised that those who railed against government should be so bad at it. They promised disruption, and that’s what they’ve delivered. In the US it was the chaos of Trump himself, and now a House of mini-Trumps that can’t tie its own shoelaces. In the UK, it looks different: we have a prime minister in Rishi Sunak whose pitch is technocratic competence. But that should not conceal two things.First, the post-2016 Tory party delivered just as much parliamentary turmoil and intra-party division as McCarthy and co served up this week. Whether it was the Commons gridlock of the two years preceding the 2019 election or the psychodrama of the three years after it, Brexit-era Conservatism has proved every bit as unhinged as Trump-era Republicanism. When it comes to burn-it-all-down politics, the Republicans’ craziest wing are mere novices compared with a master arsonist such as Liz Truss. The US and UK are simply at different points in the cycle.House Democrats should unite with moderate Republicans to elect a speaker | Robert ReichRead moreSecond, even with Sunak in charge, and though painted in less vivid colours, Brexit-era Toryism is just as paralysed as its sister movement in the US. The five-point plan unveiled in the PM’s new year address consisted mostly of the basics of state administration – growing the economy, managing inflation – rather than anything amounting to a political programme.And that’s chiefly because his party, like the Republicans, cannot agree among themselves. Consider how much Sunak has had to drop, under pressure from assorted rebels. Whether it was reform of the planning system, the manifesto commitment to build 300,000 new houses a year or the perennial pledge to grasp the nettle of social care, Sunak has had to back away from tasks that are essential for the wellbeing of the country. True, he has avoided the farcical scenes that played out this week on Capitol Hill, but that’s only because he has preferred to preserve the veneer of unity than to force a whole slew of issues. The result is a prime minister who cannot propose much more than extra maths lessons lest he lose the fractious, restive coalition that keeps him in office.None of this is coincidence. It’s in the nature of the rightwing populist project, in Britain, the US and across the globe. Brexit is the exemplar, a mission that worked with great potency as a campaign, as a slogan, but which could never translate into governing, because it was never about governing. It was about disrupting life, not organising it – or even acknowledging the trade-offs required to organise it. It offered the poetry of destruction, not the prose of competence.The Conservatives are several stages further down this road than the Republicans, perhaps because their power has been uninterrupted throughout. But in both cases, and others, the shift is unmistakable. Once parties of the right saw themselves as the obvious custodians of state authority: the natural party of government. Now they are happier shaking their fists at those they insist are really in charge. They are becoming the natural party of opposition.

37,    The speaker of the House debacle is the Maga revolution eating its children                Jan-Werner Müller              The speaker of the House debacle is the Maga revolution eating its children,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/06/house-speaker-debacle-republicans-maga-revolution,"Autocrats around the world, after a pretty bad 2022, must be delighted: just in time for the second anniversary of the Capitol insurrection, the US is providing a spectacle of democratic dysfunction for stunned global audiences to behold. But the Republican faction holding the country hostage – the farthest right inside what de facto has become a far-right party – wants to convince us that this is simply what democracy looks like – messy and frustrating, but all happening for the sake of a better result in the end. The Groundhog Day-style procedures are dignified as – in the words of failed speaker of the House candidate Byron Donalds – a “deliberative, open process” necessary for the “constitutional republic that is America”.The fact is that the Republicans blocking Kevin McCarthy’s bid for speaker are not crazy when they suggest that good-faith debate within the same political party can be beneficial for a democratic polity. Except that their political performance art is really about a refusal to accept a loss – the very core of the Trumpist playbook. This is not what democracy looks like; this is what acting out a belief in minority rule looks like.House Democrats should unite with moderate Republicans to elect a speaker | Robert ReichRead moreDemocracy inside parties is easy to ridicule. Oscar Wilde once quipped that the problem with socialism is that it takes too many evenings. What is billed as “deliberation” often means that the person who can stick around the longest – or who enjoys pontificating about political philosophy the most – wins the day: if in doubt, an educated white man who might not have to worry about the kids in the morning. Bickering inside parties also seems an obvious turn-off for voters. If even partisans supposedly agreed on political principles aren’t convinced by the program, why should anyone else be?And yet intra-party democracy is crucial for the health of democracy as a whole. People get used to good-faith disagreement on policies; the fact that they hold the same principles does not mean there can’t be debates, ideally allowing new arguments and evidence to come out. Lyndon Johnson held that “What the man on the street wants is not a big debate on fundamental issues; he wants a little medical care, a rug on the floor, a picture on the wall.” But, as his party learned the hard way, what “a little medical care” means, in practice, can be highly contentious. No principle automatically implements itself as policy; debates are necessary.What’s more, democracy inside parties gets partisans used to the idea that the other side could possibly be right – a stance crucial for democracy, in which opponents must be treated as legitimate adversaries, not as existential enemies. Losers of a conflict learn how to adopt a stance of legitimate opposition and critical loyalty: they agree on principles, but disagree about policies or even particular personalities; above all, they remain free to criticize the leadership. Naive? The absence of critical loyalty inside a party opens the path to something like January 6: no one was able to restrain Trump, as he had refashioned the Republican party into something like a personality cult. It is hardly an accident that rightwing populist leaders – think Modi, Orbán, Erdoğan – all govern their own parties in autocratic fashion.But what the far right of the far right is doing in Washington now has nothing to do with intra-party democracy. No real arguments are being offered when figures like Byron Donalds and Kevin Hern get their 15 minutes of fame. What Donalds lauds as “open process” unfolds behind closed doors; and, curiously for self-declared conservatives, blackmail aimed at radically changing the power of the speaker is pushed without serious claims about the constitution.The House speaker fiasco shows that Republicans are unable to govern | Andrew GawthorpeRead moreWhat the anti-McCarthy faction is doing is a miniature version of what the Republican party as a whole has increasingly adopted as a strategy at least since the 1990s: even if your stances are unpopular and you fail to win majorities, you somehow still want to govern. Except that this strategy is now consuming the party’s own leadership; the revolution is devouring both its radical children and the parents, like McCarthy, who benevolently looked on as the kids learned how to rampage during the Trump years.Concretely, the far right of the far right seeks a position from which to force the speaker to dominate a Democratic president through blackmail and brinkmanship. Newt Gingrich – as so often, the original model for what is playing out today – shut down the government to force Bill Clinton’s hand; John Boehner and Paul Ryan were not as willing to play hardball and paid the price. The underlying assumption is that the other party has no legitimate role in government at all and that sharing power is equal to betrayal. It is not an accident that figures like Scott Perry paint the Democrats not just as wrong, but as evil actors (he hinted that they might be like Nazis) hellbent on destroying America.This unseemly spectacle is not the debate Americans “need” and are “owed”; this is also not just instant proof that the Republican party is unable to govern, as many previews of the new Congress had asserted; rather, it is demonstration just how little has changed since the original January 6.Jan-Werner Müller teaches at Princeton and is a Guardian US columnist.

One of the worst periods of peacetime crisis in our modern history grinds on. Frighteningly, it is spreading into more and more areas of life that we’re used to thinking the state and business have largely under control. One of the world’s richest countries, even after the economic calamities of Tory rule, has in many ways become dysfunctional.Yet the response from voters seems complex and relatively muted. There is fear – please don’t let me need a hospital – and frustration at how the stoppages and shortages are dragging on. There is disbelief at the country’s accelerating deterioration; but also fatalism, a feeling that Britain was due a fall after years of cost-cutting, complacency and overindulgence. There is exhaustion at the sheer length of the disruption; and scepticism about the ability of any politician to end it. But there is less overt anger than might reasonably be expected. Unlike the early 1980s, or the early 2010s – like now, both times when Tory policies were doing immense social damage – Britain is not rioting. At least, not yet.Voters have deserted the Conservative party in the opinion polls, it is true. Support is between a third and a half lower than it was at the last election. But while this fall has produced a big lead for Labour, beneath the surface shift the polls suggest there is still a lot of flux and confusion. When YouGov asked people last month who would be the best prime minister, 39% said they were not sure, 25% said Rishi Sunak, and only 32% said Keir Starmer, despite his increasingly confident tenure as Labour leader.With possibly two years still to go until the next election – a long time in our eventful politics – a Labour government, let alone one that solves some of the country’s problems, remains quite abstract and distant for many voters. They sense that the Tories are on their way out, but they also appreciate that before that finally happens the current crisis may well get worse. A small but growing sense of anticipation about more competent and principled government under Starmer coexists with larger fears about the present and the immediate future.How might Labour – or perhaps less foreseen political forces – navigate this hugely unsettled period? Given the breadth and depth of the current crisis, and the long accumulation of its causes, at least some of the turmoil may well continue past the election and deep into the next government. If any politician can produce some appealing and effective solutions to Britain’s suddenly sharp decline, they could be in power for a long time. This may be why, in a speech on Thursday trailed as promising “a decade of national renewal”, Starmer said Labour would introduce “a completely new way of governing”.There can also be more cynical responses to national crises. Recently, Boris Johnson has begun to drop heavy hints that he could act as a national saviour. In a new year message delivered in his most drawling, charming mode, he said he was “confident that things will get better” for Britain in 2023, “lengthening our lead as the best place on Earth”. It’s easy to find this optimism absurd and offensive, coming from the person responsible for so many of our current disasters. Yet Johnson has made a career out of enough people believing his promises. Unless Sunak’s low-key and disengaged premiership wakes up, it would be foolish to rule out an attempted Johnson comeback.But the anti-crisis politicians with most potential may be outside their party, given how associated the Tories are with the chaotic status quo. The relentless Nigel Farage, the increasingly popular rightwing populists of Reform UK, or perhaps some new, millionaire-backed reactionary movement: all could use Britain’s ongoing emergencies to their advantage. In the mid-70s, an economic crisis less severe in its social effects than today’s produced a toxic flowering of new far-right groups, until Margaret Thatcher’s radicalisation of the Tories took these groups’ members and impetus away. Given that much of our media is even more rightwing and at least as panicky about the state of the country as it was in the 70s, a would-be messiah from the fringes of the right might find plenty of backers.Starmer lacks messianic qualities. Unlike Tony Blair at the equivalent stage of his Labour leadership, in the mid-90s, Starmer can’t use personal charisma to suggest that a government led by him would be fresh and dynamic. Nor does Starmer have Blair’s advantage of only having to devise solutions for a relatively contained national crisis. In the mid-90s, public services were struggling after years of Tory underfunding, but the economy was growing and many voters were feeling quite upbeat, ready to believe Labour when it said that “things can only get better”.The public mood is different now. And while the Blair era is clearly an influence on Starmer – from his use of Gordon Brown and David Blunkett as advisers to his shadow ministers’ revival of Blairite strategies such as being “tough on crime” and “reforming” public services – Starmer’s policy proposals and rhetoric increasingly suggest that he would go further than New Labour in trying to change the country. He feels he has no choice. As he summed up today’s Britain at the last Labour conference: “We can’t go on like this.”He still has a careful, hair-shirt side as a politician, warning almost with relish that a Starmer government would have to “make very difficult choices”. But the state of the country is simultaneously forcing him to be more expansive. This expansiveness is not just about winning the election. If a Starmer administration produces policies that are too small for the scale of the crisis – what he calls “sticking plaster politics” – his carefully acquired reputation for competence won’t last long.It’s also possible that he is finding being bolder quite exciting – more so than the miserably tentative “constructive opposition” of his leadership’s first phase. That a typically cautious Labour leader could end up being a conduit for public dissatisfaction with the country the Tories have created, and an architect of whatever replaces it, still feels quite an unlikely outcome.

39,    Harry’s allegations are not just about a royal fist fight – but the very real dangers of hereditary power                Gaby Hinsliff              Harry’s allegations are not just about a royal fist fight – but the very real dangers of hereditary power,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/05/prince-harry-royal-fist-fight-power-monarchy-heir,"When my younger sister was very small, I once pushed her down the stairs. Fortunately, she was still small enough to bounce. But it was the beginning, not the end, of the fighting. We pinched and slapped in the back of the car on long interminable journeys, over a fraction of an inch invasion into each other’s elbow space. We scrapped over toys and games and who got the biggest share of pudding; then over clothes and boys and who was most popular at school (all right, it was her). We fought like all siblings fight and I can’t even remember now what most of it was about, but deep down it was probably the thing most sibling fights are really about, namely who is the most loved. Luckily in our family it was never obvious who was the favourite, which may help explain why these days we love each other to death; why the older we get, the closer we have become, through the years of bringing up our own children and now into the years of looking after our parents. But as I said, we were lucky. Prince William and Prince Harry have been less so, which may explain why – according to the latter’s new book, Spare, a grimly revealing title if ever there was one – three years ago the brothers came to blows even as full-grown men.The fight was ostensibly about Harry’s wife, Meghan, and he writes angrily about his older brother calling her “difficult”, “rude” and “abrasive”, echoing the whispers beginning to circulate about her in parts of the press. But it seemingly escalated violently after Harry accused William of acting like an heir: the chosen one, around whom everything else seemingly revolves. There isn’t a sibling alive who won’t, on some level, recognise that feeling. But the twist in this case is that resentment is inexorably baked into a hereditary monarchy from birth. Its strength but also its weakness is that it exercises power through a family, with all the primordial and potentially destructive emotions that entails.Like them, loathe them, or merely long to hear no more about them ever again, in recent weeks the Sussexes have raised questions of genuine and awkward public interest. They held up an important mirror to the country by exploring the reaction, public and private, to a mixed-race royal marriage. They have served up some uncomfortable truths too about the long and sometimes grubby relationship between royals and the media, where some intrusion is grudgingly permitted in return for the nation keeping the family in the gilded style to which they have become accustomed. But this book takes the prince into a queasier realm, where the washing of dirty linen in public is no longer obviously linked to effecting change and the political gives way to the intensely personal.The details of the brothers’ alleged punch-up in a palace cottage are at once almost ridiculously trivial (he pushed me into a dog bowl!) and heartbreakingly sad. They were so young when they lost their mother, but at least they still had each other, and now it seems they don’t even have that. Harry clearly aches still to be reconciled – in trailers for yet more promotional interviews to be screened this weekend, he talks of wanting both his father and brother back – but every revelation surely makes that less likely. The younger prince’s tragedy is that the harder he fights for what he seems to want, which is to matter as much to his family as his older brother does, the further that slips out of reach.For William doesn’t come out of all this looking good, and since childhood Harry’s function in brutal dynastic terms has been to absorb criticism that might otherwise fall on his older brother. The goal of monarchy is its own survival, which means its instinct is generally to protect the heir at all costs, while the spare – the younger brother – inevitably becomes more disposable. Harry was born the understudy, the plan B, and even then only until his brother had children. Unlike in centuries past, pushing back against this quasi-feudal order of things isn’t going to get him locked up in the Tower, but this is nonetheless a sibling relationship forged with the confines of a family that still considers it reasonable to curtsey to each other. If there’s a lesson to be drawn from all this misery, beyond the bleeding obvious one that there’s something deeply unhealthy about hereditary power, it’s arguably one for parents. For sadly, it’s not only children born into immense privilege who can be left feeling like spares.The perennially wise psychologist Dorothy Rowe once wrote that sibling relationships were ultimately all about “being validated or invalidated as a person”, since they are where we learn our first indelible lessons about rivalry and resentment, victory and shame, love and hate. They’re intense enough when all you’re fighting over is who stole whose tights, never mind the vast reserves of power embodied in a crown. What siblings crave above all else is fairness – or perhaps more accurately, the sense that the other one isn’t too far ahead in the eternal and terrifying war for their parents’ attention. It is a catastrophic thing, for a child to feel the lesser loved, and the scars run deep. For the sake of spares everywhere, I hope Harry finds the peace he so clearly seeks.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist"
40,    Befriending a wild animal will make you a better human – here’s why                Kate Ahmad              Befriending a wild animal will make you a better human – here’s why,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/06/befriending-a-wild-animal-will-make-you-a-better-human-heres-why,"The movie adaptation of Tim Winton’s novel Blueback is out this week. It focuses on a friendship with a big friendly fish – the blue groper; and the powerful response to humans threatening the animal. As with My Octopus Teacher, it’s a highly emotive story, and seen by most people as unusual or unique. Because humans only befriend domestic animals such as cats and dogs. Or do they?Let’s start with the blue groper. This is a charismatic Australian native, with many interesting characteristics. They are protogynous hermaphrodites, starting life as juveniles with the potential to be male or female; and always starting as green-coloured females. The dominant male has a harem and, if he dies, the largest female will become male and adopt the striking blue hue which gives the fish its name. These fish can live up to 70 years and are the state emblem of New South Wales.Blueback review – Tim Winton adaptation hammers home its climate messageRead moreBeyond the science, these are extraordinarily curious and friendly fish. As a regular snorkeller and diver, I am often greeted by a groper who will shove his face in my camera, rub up against my hands, bop me with his lips and follow me around. Gropers appear to recognise divers and are curious about what we are doing. It is illegal to spear these animals in my home state but such is my emotional response to their friendliness, I can imagine jumping in front of a weapon aimed at one of my friends.Octopuses are similarly interactive and interested in us. They are invertebrates who have developed unique, extraordinary intelligence, diverging from us evolutionarily more than 600m years ago. They use tools and mimicry, construct shelters, steal things and are known to be escape artists when kept in captivity.In Sydney we primarily interact with the gloomy octopus (Octopus tetricus). One of my life’s highlights was the first time one of these creatures unfurled a tentacle and explored my hand. Since then I’ve had many interactions, including octopuses riding on my hand, trying desperately to steal my camera, and some who tell me to go away by blowing sand at me. Unfortunately, octopuses don’t live long – usually becoming senescent after breeding and lasting only one to two years. The ones we see regularly are often eaten by smooth stingrays in the blink of an eye. It’s hard to get too fond of them as the end is always near.Once you have a relationship and an attachment to another living creature, they become part of your sphere of compassionMoving to the land, and most of us are familiar with wild birds seeking human company. Yes, they are often after food, but who isn’t? My neighbourhood is dominated by sulphur-crested cockatoos, but it only takes a little patience to have a rainbow lorikeet or a king parrot work up the courage to stand on a human hand.Even tiny insects can notice humans and change their behaviour to interact with us. Jumping spiders are in almost everyone’s garden but you might miss them if you don’t look hard. Most are less than half a centimetre long. Lock eyes with one, however, and there’s no doubt that they see you, moving their bodies to make eye contact. Also fans of cameras, they sometimes jump right at you!Relationships with wild animals are possible and common – you can have your own Blueback or My Octopus Teacher experience. Return to the same place often enough and you’ll get to know the regulars. Getting to know animals as individuals with varying personalities and behaviour grants them elevated importance. But be aware that it is likely to push you closer to vegetarianism and inspire you towards conservation. Because once you have a relationship and an attachment to another living creature, they become part of your sphere of compassion. And then there is no choice but to protect both the animal and its environment. A “pet” blue groper or a labrador? You can have both, and it will probably make you a better human.Kate Ahmad is a neurologist and diver with an interest in human and animal behaviour and conservation"

The best place to see that is the Central Market, a tightly packed little universe of food stalls that has no room for anything mediocre. The result is an intense patch of people that are genuinely interested in food and fresh produce.I love shopping there, but it’s also a great place to grab lunch. The sandwiches at Lucia’s are as good as it gets; they get the best bread in every day, use South Australian olive oil instead of butter and the charcuterie is sliced in front of you to order. I also love Saudade, where the Portuguese custard tarts are still warm when you order them and come sprinkled with cinnamon.Portuguese custard tarts from Saudade at Adelaide’s Central Market InspirationAdelaide can be a bit conservative, but it’s also really exciting, and the Art Gallery of South Australia encapsulates both sides of that. When you walk in it feels really European and old-school, but then you go further in and find new collections and fantastic contemporary works. I’m really drawn to Nora Heysen’s flower paintings, and Tarnanthi is an incredible festival that highlights the unpredictable and unconventional approach taken by a lot of Indigenous work.Cellar doors and sunsets: romantic Australian mini-breaks under $500Read moreFrom there, you can tick a lot of art boxes within a 15-minute walk of the gallery.

There’s so much to see, you could get lost for a whole day; the Palm House is a delicate building with panes of vivid blue glass that make it feel otherworldly. The Amazon Waterlily Pavilion is incredible and the giant lilies look like something from a film set. But my favourite place is the Museum of Economic Botany, an austere time capsule of objects connected to farming and plants in South Australia. It’s a peaceful sanctuary within the garden, and a reminder that Europeans weren’t always here.The Palm House in Adelaide’s Botanic Garden.

They completely changed the atmosphere at night and made the city more accessible, diverse and welcoming. Now you can always find a bar that suits your mood. Udaberri is the original small bar and still one of the best, while Hains & Co is refined and has expertly made drinks.

42,"Leading questions    My partner and I love to travel, but he dismisses my ideas. How can we work together?              For some people, knowing the right way to do things can be a point of pride – but there are ways to make planning collaborative, writes advice columnist              Eleanor Gordon SmithMy partner and I love to travel, but he dismisses my ideas. How can we work together?",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/06/my-partner-and-i-love-to-travel-but-he-dismisses-my-ideas-how-can-we-work-together,"My partner and I love to travel. We had both travelled extensively before meeting each other and are excited to do it together forever. My problem is this: he thinks his way of doing research and booking hotels/experiences is the only legitimate way to do it. Usually, to avoid an argument, I go with the flow and allow him to make all the plans and arrangements. To be fair, he does ask my opinion, however, if I suggest something different he generally poo-poos it.We are struggling now because I’m starting to feel marginalised and dismissed. He wants to be in charge but also complains that he “has to do all the planning”. How do you think we can resolve this and work together on planning without resenting how the other one does their “research”?~Eleanor says: For some people, knowing more than others is a way of demonstrating superiority. This is a weird phenomenon, because whether you know more than others or are right about what you think you know is frequently a matter of luck. All the same, for some people, knowing the Right way to do things can become a real point of pride. It can seem (to them) to demonstrate good things about them; they’re tasteful, shrewd, conscientious.My boyfriend occasionally takes drugs. Is it unreasonable to end our relationship because of it?Read moreAnd in fact they can be right – it can be a blessing to have someone in the household who makes sure you won’t get swindled by a tour company or book something that looks better than it is. The hazard is when Knowing Lots turns into Knowing Best; when knowledge isn’t something you’re excited to share and grow together, but something one of you has and the other doesn’t. Knowledge can start to feel zero-sum in the relationship, like the possibility that you have some necessarily implies that he has less.It seems to me the challenge is to wrest back the idea that planning and organising is something you both could share. How can you make this collaborative again?One thing to get clear on is if this is genuinely a matter of not liking your “research” or if he just doesn’t want to do what you want to do. If you love group tours and he hates them, or one of you loves restaurants and the other street food, there’s no need to pretend that’s a planning problem or even that someone must be getting it wrong. You can just make time for different activities on your holidays. There’s only so much that two separate individuals can be expected to converge on indefinitely: it might be healthy (and fun!) to do separate things some days. That way you don’t always have to be jointly planning joint activities, and when you enjoy your own side mission, that might be unavoidable proof to him that you can plan after all.Another strategy might be to tell a lot of stories from your time travelling alone. How did you solve problems, foresee complications, have a good time even when it went wrong? It’s perilously easy for people to project an image on to you and then start seeing it as though it were real: you can remind him you were planning a lot on your own before he started thinking you couldn’t.Worst comes to worst, if you want someone to know something, there’s always the option of telling him: you can say, “I’ve actually travelled a lot and it makes me feel minimised when you think I just don’t know how to plan things. Can you tell me what you think I don’t get right?” If he’s a good enough sport, you might even be able to make some fun of it – have one day that you plan by yourself, laugh at how wrong (by his standards) it could possibly go.It’s a yerchsome feeling to spend your finite holiday time and money in a way that disappoints. But you know that, too. You’ll both be resentful if planning and knowing start to feel like skills only one of you has.

45,You be the judge  Should my girlfriend stop using my toothbrush?              She can’t understand why she shouldn’t use her boyfriend’s brush. He bristles at the very thought. Who should clean up their act?            Should my girlfriend stop using my toothbrush?,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/06/you-be-the-judge-should-my-girlfriend-stop-using-my-toothbrush,"The prosecution: DaveLara says sharing my toothbrush is just the same as us kissing. But it’s not. It’s grossThere’s quite a few gross things about being in a relationship, but I’ll stick with the PG-rated ones for now: I hate it when my girlfriend Lara uses my toothbrush.It happens whenever she stays over at mine, or when we go away for weekends. She never seems to pack her own. We’ve been together just under a year and it’s time for Lara to start remembering to bring one.She stays over around three times a week, but instead of buying a toothbrush and leaving it at mine, she brings her own back and forth. But often forgets. When she remembers, she makes a big deal out of it and asks, “Are you happy now?” The truth is, I’m more unhappy every time she forgets.Even if we were married, I’d still find sharing a toothbrush repulsive. You use it to scrub away nasty gunk from your teeth and mouth – then you’re expected to share it with someone else and take in all their nasty bacteria.When Lara says, “But we kiss, isn’t that the same?” My answer is a firm “No, it’s not.” When you kiss someone, you aren’t deliberately dislodging the food particles from between their teeth. You don’t run your tongue vigorously along their teeth. It’s totally different. I want to kiss Lara but I’ll be damned if I want her to brush the bacteria from her teeth with my toothbrushI want to kiss her, but I’ll be damned if I want her to brush the plaque from her teeth with my toothbrush. When Lara uses my toothbrush, I’ll say, “This is gross. Do you have to?” but she says it’ll be worse and less hygienic for me to experience her bad breath.We’ll argue, I’ll let her use it at the time, then the next morning she’ll use it again. Then I’ll throw it away and get a new one.I’ve taken it upon myself to keep a pack of spare brushes for her, but Lara sometimes takes one home by accident instead of leaving it here. We’re locked into this cycle of arguing about not having a toothbrush on hand – but it’s totally her fault. When I stay over at hers, which is only once a week or so, I’ll always bring mine. Why can’t she just do the same? Or just leave one here? I don’t ever want to share mine again.The defence: LaraI don’t know why it’s such a big deal for Dave. I think it’s more of an ego thing than a hygiene thingI don’t get why toothbrush sharing is a the big deal, I really don’t. We’re a couple and we often kiss. We’re already committed to putting our tongues in each other’s mouths, so what does it matter if we share a toothbrush ?Dave says there’s a difference between swapping bodily bacteria (for pleasure) and swapping food bacteria that comes from a toothbrush, which he says is out of laziness and should be avoided. I see that, but it’s not like I’m his sibling. I’m his girlfriend. It should not gross him out as much as it does.When I stay over, I do sometimes bring my own toothbrush but, as it’s electric, it doesn’t fit in my overnight makeup bag. I’ll rock up at Dave’s and sneakily try to use his toothbrush, but he always makes a huge deal out of it.He’ll say something like: “This is disgusting, you’re grim.” But he has a normal, non-electric toothbrush, which isn’t even as good for removing food, so what’s the big deal if we share? It’s not like there are loads of bits of food hanging off it.I saw Dave throw away his brush after I’d used it and I think that’s really over the topPart of the problem is that I go to his house more than he comes to mine. I am a bit scatty so I’ll always forget something. If he stayed at mine more, perhaps the toothbrush would be less of an issue. I saw Dave throw away his toothbrush the next day after I’d used it, which is really over the top.He’s now taken to buying cheap plastic ones for me to use when I stay at his, but on a couple occasions I’ve accidentally taken them home so the next time I go around, I borrow his again. That drives him nuts.I think this is more of an ego thing than a hygiene thing for Dave. He has a load of gross habits – I won’t reveal them all here, but let’s just say his record is not unblemished when it comes to personal hygiene. He’s been known to skip the odd shower.Sign up to Inside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of our brand new magazine, Saturday.

And I don’t think I should apologise for that as I make more of an effort to go to his than he does coming to mine. The jury of Guardian readersShould Lara stop using Dave’s toothbrush?Dave’s theory reminds me of Trump’s super insane, bleach-based cure for Covid. Dave’s differentiation between kissing and toothbrushing is as flimsy as his argument as a whole. I say keep on brushing or else quit kissing.Rory, 55Sexy kissing isn’t the same as oral hygiene. Lara’s communal approach to toothbrushes has reached the end of the road, and she needs to change her ways. But old habits die hard, and perhaps Dave should start hiding his toothbrushes to prove a point.Amber, 45Sharing a toothbrush is unhygienic (and, given the prevalence of Strep A, potentially dangerous). It also clearly annoys Dave, so could damage the relationship. Lara should buy either a second toothbrush or a bigger overnight bag, neither of which seem like unreasonable asks.Paul, 47Even if Lara were right about the harmless nature of swapping “food bacteria”, which she isn’t, she should respect Dave’s wishes. It comes down to consent and consideration of your partner’s feelings is crucial.Dave, 57Lara should respect that sharing his toothbrush is out of Dave’s comfort zone. He may be rather unrelaxed about this, but she has to accept how he feels. Lara could buy an electric toothbrush to keep at Dave’s, which would also be too heavy to accidentally get carried home.

46,"    Amid babies galore I’m a Childless Gay Aunt. I could not be happier              Rebecca Shaw                         Closely allied to Guncles, the CGA is progressive, fun, cosmopolitan. She has all the streaming services            Amid babies galore I’m a Childless Gay Aunt. I could not be happier",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/06/amid-babies-galore-im-a-childless-gay-aunt-i-could-not-be-happier,"I’m not sure how it happened but there has been a huge explosion in the number of babies around me. One minute my friends and I were all at the pub having too many beers for a Thursday evening and the next a flock of storks descended upon us. Everywhere I turn there is a friend announcing pregnancy, or a friend bedridden with pregnancy vomiting, or me, a regular person, vomiting when someone posts one of those 3D ultrasounds of their baby (sorry, they’re haunting and I’m scared), or a baby’s first birthday or a brand new baby to visit. It’s babies galore and I could not be happier. Not only are children cute but with each infant brought into my life I can more deeply inhabit the life role I have been granted. I am a Childless Gay Aunt.Being ‘one and done’ is certainly more common, so is it good or bad being an only child? | Maddie Thomas Read moreLet me run you through what I mean – I am gay, I am childless and I am an aunt. It’s important to note here that when I talk about being an aunt, I don’t just mean children I am related to by blood. Being queer and building community means forming special bonds with your friends (even the straight ones), establishing friendships that are like family, reinforcing the love, care and support that you choose to give, and hopefully seeing it last the coming decades. I have always had a soft spot for aunts of all kinds. There was nothing I loved more growing up than the special treat of getting to leave my brothers at home while I went to stay in another city with one of my hilarious, smart, outspoken aunts. In the sweet spot I was old enough to have fun with them (and try sips of wine) while they were young enough to not yet be interested in settling down. For a short magical window I had all their attention before it was cruelly ripped away by the births of their own children.It feels special to watch someone you love become a parentBecoming a CGA is not something that I chose. I knew I was queer from an early age but the childless part is just the way the cookie has crumbled, and by cookie I mean my disused uterus. Unless something surprising happens, I am probably going to remain childless. That will free me up to reach the peak of my gay aunt powers. All the biology at play inside me, forcing me to enjoy the smell of a baby’s head, or giving me the instinct to keep a baby in my care alive, will not be funnelled into my own offspring but instead flung out at the babies around me.I’m not trying to claim that any type of aunt is superior – all of them are wonderful. They love you and are excited to see you, treat you a little bit like an adult and spill secrets about your parents. Along with regular aunts, CGAs also have a strong alliance with Guncles (gay uncles) and Cool Young Uncles. But the CGA is progressive, fun, cosmopolitan. She has all the streaming services. You can talk to her about everything, because there is nothing she loves more than gossip and you know she will be chill. Most importantly, you can rely on her never to have children (except for the series of tabby cats she weirdly insists on calling her babies) and give you her undivided attention. It may just be the kind of kid I was and what I craved from life – but that seems to be the ideal. It’s a role I’m excited to fill.I know some people struggle with their friendship group changing as children are born but for this CGA it has been a delight. Sure, your friends might not have as much time for you now but it feels special to watch someone you love become a parent. It is also fascinating and funny to see someone you’ve witnessed do things like drink a beer out of a shoe get equally pumped about their baby taking a bottle. It’s lovely to see them evolve and prioritise this person they’ve made.It is so special to me to be invited to be part of my friends’ lives, and to be chosen as one of the people they want to have an influence on their baby. It is even more special to be able to give the baby back when you leave, and go on to sleep soundly for eight hours every night in your own bed. This is the prerogative of a CGA. I’m excited to see what kind of people all these babies turn out to be – and I can’t wait to force them to spend time with me forever.Rebecca Shaw is a writer based in Sydney"
47,Music  Daniel Barenboim to resign from Berlin State Opera role due to poor health              Conductor and pianist says he can ‘no longer achieve the level of performance required of a general music director’            Daniel Barenboim to resign from Berlin State Opera role due to poor health,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/06/daniel-barenboim-step-down-berlin-state-opera-poor-health,"The conductor and pianist Daniel Barenboim has announced his resignation as general music director of the Berlin State Opera due to his declining health.The 80-year-old has been leading the Staatsoper since 1992 and expressed his gratitude in a statement for the 30 years of collaboration, “which in all respects, both musically and personally, have enabled us to fly”, he said.Barenboim, who is among the pre-eminent conductors in the world, has served as music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Orchestre de Paris and La Scala in Milan. But his lifelong love affair with German music and his intense interest in the country’s post-cold war reunification led to him committing himself passionately to Berlin.Daniel Barenboim on ageing, mistakes and why Israel and Iran are twin brothersRead moreHe is credited with reviving the Staatskapelle, the orchestra of the opera house on the Unter den Linden boulevard in former East Berlin, which had sunk into relative obscurity under communism. He took it to new artistic heights and international prominence after the fall of the Berlin Wall.He also built a reputation as a staunch defender of culture in Germany, fighting politicians tooth and nail on many occasions – most notably opposing a threat to merge the Staatsoper in the east of Berlin with the Deutsche Oper in the west. Barenboim said the move would “not destroy the building … but the people inside”, as well as the Staatskapelle’s unique sound developed under its former artistic director Richard Strauss.He described that sound as being “based on a set of values that have gone slightly out of fashion today … of harmony [and] legato, over the values of brilliance … a more spiritual and less athletic way of playing.”In an interview with the Guardian in 2000, an incandescent Barenboim said politicians who backed the merger were carrying out nothing less than a “western takeover” of the Staatsoper, one of east Germany’s most valuable cultural assets, in the same way western Germans had taken over companies, universities and almost every other aspect of the former German Democratic Republic. In the end he won the fight.More recently he secured the political backing for the construction of Berlin’s first recital venue, the Pierre Boulez Saal, which opened in 2017. He was also behind the creation of the Barenboim-Said Akademie, a foundation to promote cooperation among up and coming musicians from Middle Eastern and north African countries and championed an orchestra for young Arab and Israeli musicians.Barenboim, who was the first person to hold both Israeli and Palestinian passports, has long been a vocal critic of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.Born in Buenos Aires to Jewish professional piano players, he gave his first public appearance at the age of seven, his first international performance aged 10, and went on to have a glittering career, first as a pianist, then as a conductor, beginning in London at the South Bank in 1968.In 1966 he married the British cellist Jacqueline du Pré, in what was one of the most celebrated unions in the classical music world. Du Pré died from multiple sclerosis in 1987 aged 42. In 1988 Barenboim married the Russian pianist Elena Bashkirova.Last October Barenboim announced he was stepping back from performing after a diagnosis of the neurological condition vasculitis, a term for rheumatic conditions that cause painful inflammation of the blood vessels.In his statement on Friday, he said: “Unfortunately the state of my health has worsened considerably in the past year. I can no longer achieve the level of performance which is rightly required of a general music director. As a result, I ask for your understanding that I will be giving up this role as from 31 January 2023.” He said he had asked Berlin’s senator for culture to release him from his contract.Sign up to Sleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

At his request, the conductor Christian Thielemann took over his role.In his statement Barenboim expressed his pride at what he and the Staatsoper had achieved. “I believe that the Staatsoper and I were extremely lucky to have each other. I am happy and proud in particular, that the Staatskapelle elected me to be their chief conductor for life. We have become a musical family over the years and will always remain so.”The Guardian view on Daniel Barenboim: a musical and moral beacon | EditorialRead moreBarenboim said he planned to continue conducting whenever possible. “Of course, I will stay – as long as I live – closely connected to music and am ready to conduct, especially with the Staatskapelle.”The Berlin Philharmonic said Barenboim would go ahead and conduct three performances as scheduled this weekend. Earlier this week he conducted two sold-out new year concerts of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony at the Staatsoper, which were also beamed on screens to crowds outside the opera house.Matthias Schulz, the Staatsoper director, said the house was “eternally grateful” to Barenboim and had “great respect” for his decision.“For more than 30 years he has let his inexhaustible strength as an artistic personality with global renown benefit this house and his Staatskapelle Berlin,” he said. “One can only imagine how hard it must have been for Daniel Barenboim to take this step. We all wish him all the best.”"
48,Books  Hanif Kureishi says he may never be able to walk or hold pen again after fall in Rome              Novelist and screenwriter says he is unable to move arms and legs and has undergone spinal surgery            Hanif Kureishi says he may never be able to walk or hold pen again after fall in Rome,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/06/hanif-kureishi-fall-rome-spinal-surgery-novelist-screenwriter,"The novelist and screenwriter Hanif Kureishi has said he may never be able to walk or use a pen again after a fall on Boxing Day in Rome.The Buddha of Surburbia author has now tweeted about the incident, following reports in the Italian media that he was in intensive care. “I had just seen Mo Salah score against Aston Villa, sipped half a beer, when I began to feel dizzy”, Kureishi wrote. “I leant forward and put my head between my legs; I woke up a few minutes later in a pool of blood, my neck in a grotesquely twisted position, my wife on her knees beside me.”The author said he then “became divorced” from himself and saw “a scooped, semicircular object with talons attached scuttling towards me”, which turned out to be his own hand. “I believed I was dying. I believed I had three breaths left.”His wife, Monique Proudlove, heard him shouting and came to his aid. “She saved my life,” Kureishi said.Kureishi is still in the Gemelli hospital in Rome, where he has been since the fall. He said he cannot move his arms and legs, which he described as “humiliating, degrading and a burden for others”.Hanif Kureishi: ‘Racism makes people mad – it’s necessary to deal with this in fiction’Read moreHe said that he has had an operation on his spine and will begin physiotherapy and rehabilitation as soon as possible. “I want to thank the doctors and nurses at the hospital for all their extraordinary kindness, competence and care,” he said.The writer asked his followers whether any of them knew of any voice-assisted hardware and software that would allow him “to watch, write and begin work again, and continue some kind of half life”.Kureishi first found international acclaim in 1985 for his Oscar-nominated screenplay My Beautiful Laundrette, about a young British Pakistani man and his white boyfriend, and is known for his sharp takes on multiculturalism, class and the legacy of empire. He is the author of seven novels, including The Buddha of Suburbia, which won the Whitbread first novel award in 1990, as well as a number of short stories, essays, plays and screenplays."

Hussey and Whiting, now in their seventies, each won a Golden Globe for their performances.In the lawsuit filed in Los Angeles on 30 December, Hussey and Whiting accuse Paramount of sexually exploiting them as young actors and distributing nude scenes of adolescents. They also claim to have suffered “mental anguish and emotional distress” in the years since the film was made and to have lost out on job opportunities. Damages are being sought “believed to be in excess of $500m”.The actors’ lawyer, Solomon Gresen, told Variety earlier this week that the nude scene was filmed when the pair “were very young naive children in the 1960s who had no understanding of what was about to hit them”.Zeffirelli said he believed the film’s two producers, John Brabourne and Anthony Havelock-Allan, had consent forms from the actors’ parents.Sign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a brief statement posted on Facebook on Friday, the promoters Southern Extremeties said the tour had been cancelled “for reasons beyond our control”.The original venue for the Sydney leg of the tour, University of Sydney’s Manning Bar, was the first to pull out of the shows following pushback from students in December.

Shortly before the cancellation of the tour, the scheduled venue in Adelaide, Enigma Bar, announced it would no longer be hosting the band.The group was billed to be supported by the US-based band Akhlys, whose career has also been marred with allegations of associations with far-right ideology.Ithaca: ‘We said: “Stop supporting racist bands”. Our Facebook page was flooded with Nazis’Read moreIn 2018 Taake had to cancel their North American tour after an online campaign highlighting previous incidents, including a 2007 performance in the German city of Essen in which the lead singer, known as Hoest, appeared with a swastika painted on his chest.Hoest denied he sympathised with nazism, but in a statement labelled the owner of the Essen venue an Untermensch (subhuman), a term deployed by the Nazis in relation to Jews, Slavs and others they considered non-Aryan.Following the cancellation of the US tour Taake released a statement blaming “McCarthy witch hunts” and “illegal activities of Antifa and its supporters” for applying pressure on venues and promoters.The statement said: “We have explained on many, many occasions, the history behind what caused the problems … but just for the sake of clarity Taake is not now, has never been, and never will be a Nazi band.”The antifascist research group White Rose Society noted that Hoest had also performed on a song called Jew Killer by the band the Meads of Asphodel, on their album The Murder of Jesus the Jew.

It has been treading water for the past six years, drip-fed by the federal government to the tune of about $5m annually.The last tranche of that funding is set to run out in July. While there remains a possibility that Trove will be thrown a last-minute lifeline in the May budget, that will come just weeks before it could be forced to cease operations.Last week, the arts minister, Tony Burke, publicly indicated that Trove’s future will not be addressed in the federal government’s new cultural policy, which will be announced on 30 January.Labor to impose streaming content quotas and boost funding for writers and musiciansRead moreThe National Library’s director general, Marie-Louise Ayres, said she was waiting to hear from the government.“We’ve had no indications about future funding of Trove,” she said.“We’re at a point now where we can’t continue to run our business on a funding model that is just not fit for purpose and doesn’t recognise what modern Australia needs from it national cultural institutions.“I’m an optimist. I believe our case is very good … but it’s coming to the point when we will need to think very carefully about which parts of the service we could continue running and which we could not [post July 2023] – and they’re very, very big decisions.”Dr Mike Jones, a historian at the Australian National University recently wrote in the Conversation about the possible consequences of the closure, saying many students had raised concerns with him about the viability of projects planned for 2023, with no guarantee of Trove’s ongoing viability.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads“A student I spoke to yesterday, who’s just starting his PhD, was wondering if he needed to reshape his whole methodology and rethink what was happening if there was a chance that Trove was going to go,” he said.“Given the reliance on Trove by historians and many other researchers, suddenly not having that sort of platform available will increase the cost of research projects, it will mean that people will need more research time, they’ll potentially need to visit more institutions physically than they did in the past. They may even need to reshape projects completely and it might make some projects that are currently viable simply not possible, because if they’re using large scale historical data or cultural heritage data, it’s simply not feasible without that kind of platform there.Sign up to Five Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

But Trove is also used by the broader Australian population – by local historians, by family historians, researchers, by people trying to find out about their own families, their own histories.”According to the National Library’s modelling, Trove will need about $32m over the next four years to upgrade its ageing digital archival system. Introducing a paywall for users is not an option, Ayres said.“From the very beginnings of the National Library’s work in the digital space, and we’ve been in this space now for well over 20 years, we have had one great driver – democratising access to our collections and the collections of other cultural institutions and making sure that they’re available to all Australians regardless of where they live, who they are, and their ability to pay,” she said.“Free access to information is fundamental to libraries, and it is to us. So from our perspective, egalitarian access is what drives us and we have no interest at all in moving to an alternate model.”‘A cultural masterpiece’: the world’s best new public libraries – in picturesRead moreThe National Library and its Trove service is one of six national Canberra-based cultural institutions that have been struggling to do more with less over a period of more than three decades, when the government introduced the concept of efficiency dividends to government-funding bodies in the late 1980s.In 2016, the Turnbull government slashed a further $20m in funding collectively from the National Library, the National Portrait Gallery, the Museum of Australian Democracy, the National Film and Sound Archive, and the National Gallery of Australia.In his address last Friday, Burke said there was “a lot of outcry at the moment and justified outcry” about funding of Canberra’s collecting institutions, saying it was due to “systematic underfunding that has happened for a long period of time”.“There will be major decisions that the government will take in dealing with those challenges,” he said."

The death rate is now the highest it has been since mid-August when 143 deaths were recorded in a single week.The federal aged care minister, Anika Wells, said the government had moved quickly to prepare for Covid waves before they hit, supplying personal protective equipment, rapid antigen tests, a surge workforce and additional supports.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundupThe fourth dose vaccine rates are currently at more than 83% for the eligible aged care population and the government is continuing to prioritise anti-virals and vaccines for older Australians.“We must remain vigilant and work together to protect older Australians most at risk of developing serious illness,” Wells said.“We urge everyone to remember CovidSafe basics when visiting older people. Make sure your vaccinations are up to date, wash your hands, wear a mask, hold your visits outdoors and reschedule if you feel unwell.”The government delivered three-day PPE packs from the national medical stockpile to all aged care facilities ahead of summer and is providing outbreak PPE upon request. It is also providing in-reach Covid-19 pathology testing until 30 April for residential aged care homes experiencing an outbreak.Providers are being given rapid tests for surveillance screening and financial support for the costs associated with managing outbreaks. Antivirals are also being provided from the national medical stockpile if local pharmacies are out of stock.Other weekly Covid data, released by the states and territories on Friday, shows a similar increase in total death figures in both Victoria and New South Wales.In Victoria, deaths rose to 108 from 69 the week prior, while in NSW, the number of deaths rose from 32 to 77. South Australia’s death toll remained largely stable while Western Australia’s dropped.The worsening situation in aged care comes as the sector warns of fundamental problems with the financial viability of providers.A report on the sector published by StewartBrown shows seven of 10 residential aged care facilities are currently operating at a loss. The analysis, first reported by the Australian, shows facilities lost $21.29 a bed each day in the September quarter, on average, compared to $7.30 the year prior.The report suggests the annual loss for the sector totals about $1.4bn. Occupancy levels are also down, falling from 95% in 2018 to 91%."

I want it to work. I want people in NSW to have confidence their loved ones are not throwing away their money.

I had formed a judgment the Americans would have facilitated exactly that.”The revelation prompted criticism from experts including Marcus Hellyer, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, who said this had not been agreed by the US government and it would be a “pretty serious kind of breach or leak [to disclose it]” if it had.“No boats are available before 2030 unless the US gives up its own – that would be quite remarkable – the US has been clear there is no way they can build additional submarines,” Hellyer told Guardian Australia at the time."

This loss will be felt far and wide across the Wide Bay and Burnett.”"

He admitted bulk-billing rates were declining while gap fees rose.“After nine years of cuts and neglect to Medicare, it has never been harder to see a doctor, and never more expensive,” Butler told reporters on Thursday.The government’s Strengthening Medicare taskforce is expected to report by the end of the month with recommendations to inform the May budget. Robson said to encourage doctors to bulk bill – instead of charging patients direct – Medicare rebates had to increase dramatically.“Mark Butler has said it’s a high priority for him, he has some funding … but what’s been proposed is not getting anywhere near to touching the sides of what we need,” he said. “We have to increase rebates. You can’t find any other way around it.”Robson claimed it was no longer financially sustainable for GPs to rely on Medicare funding alone. “It’s catastrophically bad to get in to see doctors in small towns or non-urban areas,” he said.Dr Nicole Higgins, the president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, claimed that doctors had missed out on billions in recent years due to the Coalition-era rebate freeze and indexation of fees below inflation.“Under successive governments over time, we’ve got to a stage where GPs can no longer afford to bulk bill the majority of patients,” the Mackay GP said.“Most of them are small community businesses. They have to pay staff, utilities, rent, and if they accept only Medicare for services, they can’t keep the doors open … the cost of Medicare hasn’t kept up with providing services.”Higgins said in towns like Mackay “the bulk-billing rate is dropping and starting to accelerate” and many doctors could no longer “subsidise” vulnerable patients by bulk-billing some and charging fees to others.Dr Stephen Duckett, an honorary professor at Melbourne University and a former secretary of the federal health department, said reforms were needed in primary care.Sign up to Guardian Australia's Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matterPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Duckett said Australia needed to rethink how healthcare looked and operated.“The primary care system is overwhelmingly GP-oriented, with a focus on doctors. General practice has to be more multi-disciplinary, we need to use nurses more, physios, podiatrists,” he said.Higher Medicare rebates will not cure broken system that rewards ‘speed, not need’, report saysRead more“The old model of a solo GP has faded a long time ago. GPs recognise the skills other professionals have. We need to build a new model and make it financially viable for a room in the GP to be occupied by a nurse.”Duckett warned that paying doctors more – without adjusting the incentive regime – could result in some GPs offering fewer services because they could make more money in less time.“Simply throwing more money at rebates is not a good solution,” he said.Leanne Boase, the president of the Australian College of Nurse Practitioners, called for the debate to be wider than GPs.Nurses should be better deployed and permitted to carry out critical roles, especially in rural areas, she said. Many were qualified to fulfil similar roles to GPs such as evaluations for psychologist referrals.“We have a really good opportunity – the system is broken now and this allows us to rebuild it with a consumer or patient focus,” Boase said.“A pay rise for GPs will fix very little. There’s more to this than simply examining the GPs’ role, we need to look at the whole system.”Boase called for cuts to red tape preventing properly trained nurse practitioners from carrying out more tasks – to boost workforce numbers and access.“Positioning GPs as the sole gatekeeper to health actually jeopardises people’s health. Medicare belongs to Australians, not to doctors.”"

The social media giant maintains it will reject other referendum ads that breach policies – except those from politicians.The referendum on a voice to parliament is slated for the second half of 2023. Supporters and opponents will launch their formal campaigns in February.TV and online material has been running for months, with a new round of Facebook ads launched in late December and tens of thousands of dollars already spent by the campaigns.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundupAdvance, a conservative lobby group spearheading the no side, spent $22,601 in the 30 days to 2 January, according to Facebook ad library data. The Uluru Statement from the Heart page dropped $23,322 on Facebook ads in that period, while the From The Heart organisation, one of the main vehicles of the yes campaign, spent $16,352.The ad library shows From The Heart is targeting its highest-spending ads overwhelmingly at voters under age 45 and barely going after older voters, while Advance’s ads are being targeted heavily towards voters aged over 55 and almost entirely avoiding people under 35.Facebook’s ad system lets advertisers serve ads to specific audiences by age, location or interests, allowing posts to be highly targeted to certain demographics or kept essentially invisible from others.One From The Heart post, launched on 21 December with the message “time for Australia to say #YES!”, recorded more than 1m impressions with an ad spend of up to $3000. Of that audience, 35% were between the ages 18-24, and another 38% were between 25-34. In all, 97% of the ad’s audience was under age 44, meaning practically no Australian over the age of 45 was targeted that ad.Nearly all of From The Heart’s most recent Facebook ads heavily target younger voters. One notable exception is an ad quoting constitutional law professor Anne Twomey’s assessment that the voice would not have veto power over parliament; 70% of that ad’s audience was over 55.Conversely, Advance’s ads seem targeted at the other end of the spectrum.One post, boosted on 23 December with a spend of up to $1,500 for 125,000 impressions, claims the voice proposal will leave Australia “divided by race”. It features the image of, and a quote from, Nationals senator Jacinta Price, a leading no advocate and a former Advance spokeswoman.Sign up to Guardian Australia's Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matterPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Only 3% of its audience was aged under 44, and it targeted zero people under age 35.Many of Advance’s ads are targeted heavily at Facebook users in Queensland. 39% of one recent ad’s audience was in Queensland, 25% in New South Wales and just 16% in Victoria, despite Queensland being the least-populous of those states.For a referendum to succeed, voters in a majority of states must back the change, as well as a national majority. This means that no more than two states can oppose the change, if it is to pass.From The Heart has boosted 28 separate ads in the last 30 days, while Advance has boosted 134. Nine of Advance’s ads, however, were removed by Facebook, with the company claiming it was “because it goes against Meta Advertising Policies”.Those ads were pulled on the basis of a 23 December fact-check from RMIT University’s FactLab, one of Facebook’s independent verified fact-check agencies, after Advance claimed the voice would lead to “one race of people with special rights and privileges handed to them”.RMIT rated this “false”. Asked why the ads were removed, and which advertising policies Advance breached, a Meta spokesperson told Guardian Australia that the company “reject ads that have been rated as false by fact checkers” and did not resile from its decision to stop the ads.“Meta partners with independent fact checkers in Australia to help reduce the spread of misinformation online, and the fact checkers themselves decide which posts to review,” they said.However, despite pledging to remove future ads rated false by fact-checkers, Facebook does not apply the same standard to direct speech from politicians.Office holders and political candidates are not eligible to be fact-checked by the third-party program, with Facebook policy stating that it believes people should hear what politicians are saying so voters can make their own judgments."

Peter Allen, whose maraca-wielding, chart-topping hits blared out of the car radio on our long drives home, was from nearby Tenterfield. Once I realised I was not the only local boy who could shake his hips and wear bright colours, I abandoned any need to hide my enthusiasm at the school dance.Not ‘the only gay in the village’: Hay rolls out welcome mat for rainbow communityRead moreFour decades later when I returned to live in the region with my husband, both of us battle-scarred from equality campaigning, it was a delight to see Tenterfield announce an annual music festival in honour of Allen (1944-1992).It was high time. Allen acknowledged his home town in Tenterfield Saddler, the 1972 ballad with all the cockatoos, kangaroos and tragedy of the best bush poems. The track – a tribute to his grandfather, saddler George Woolnough – accelerated Allen’s songwriting career, which included two Grammy nominations and an Oscar.There could be no greater accolades for a country boy who performed multiple shows a week in pubs to support his family after his father’s suicide.I helped the festival organisers with media content in their first year. It should, given Allen’s fame, have been an easy task, but I watched as they struggled to secure sponsorship deals with leading rural brands, which throw money at other music festivals in the bush. More disappointing was the old scuttle that did the rounds, about how Allen had wanted to charge Tenterfield big money when the town invited him for a return performance in the early 1980s.Music writer Stephen MacLean investigated that claim in his 1996 biography of Allen, The Boy from Oz. The fee was only $11,000, which would have covered Allen’s expenses for band and equipment; but MacLean found “local gossip” had inflated that as high as $200,000. The show never happened.Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletterThe legacy of three-time Academy Award-winning costumier Orry-Kelly (1897-1964) fared much worse in his home town of Kiama on the NSW south coast.Kelly was barely mentioned in the dairy region’s history prior to a 2015 documentary about his life. He had spent his early years in the town, where his father was a tailor, before moving to Sydney and the US to become one of Hollywood’s great costume designers.Along the way, he had a relationship with English vaudeville performer Archie Leach, who would later change his name to Cary Grant.What Allen and Orry-Kelly had in common was that they lived full lives as gay men, long before homosexuality was decriminalised in Australia. They also faced untimely deaths that some consider self-inflicted. ‘I no longer question who I am’: they’re rural, trans and staying putRead moreIt seems the higher our rural LGBTQ+ pioneers fly, the harder many of us need to see them fall. The cheap shots at their reputations were designed to plough the brightest of the tall poppies into the dirt.MacLean’s investigation of Allen’s Tenterfield homecoming revealed that the antipathy between the town fathers and their most famous son was likely mutual, but that was no reason to malign anyone for 40 years, over moneys that were never spent.Despite the support of locals who celebrate Allen’s legacy, the pause button has been hit on his festival, silencing an ambitious program of platforming emerging rural musical talent. In 2017, Kiama remembered Orry-Kelly by renaming an outdoor theatre after him, although his childhood home was recently relocated to make way for a new building.This subtle erasure of regional diversity can damage the sense of belonging for LGBTQ+ residents, our families and allies.

The regional city chose to rise above the anonymous barb in the Times obituary that labelled Helpmann (1909-1986) a “homosexual of the proselytising kind”.Compare that with pioneering celebrity chef Bernard King (1934-2002). If he’s remembered anywhere in his home town of Maleny in rural Queensland, it’s not obvious.With World Pride Sydney just around the corner, there is just as much potential for generating lasting pride – and visitation – in the regions, by acknowledging the rural origins of LGBTQ+ public figures such as Cate McGregor, who hails from Toowoomba, Queensland; and Yorta Yorta woman Deborah Cheetham from Yuin country on the NSW south coast.Molly Meldrum and Portia de Rossi emerged from rural Victoria; Bob Brown from Oberon, NSW; Benjamin Law from Nambour, Queensland; and Hannah Gadsby from Smithton, Tasmania.The process has already started, but there are many more who would probably welcome invitations from country councils to participate in the burgeoning rural LGBTQ+ events calendar.A few bridges may need to be built, but making the effort could attract the support of LGBTQ+-friendly sponsors and outreach services that are bringing hope and validation to country communities.In Tenterfield Saddler, which has at its heart a search for belonging, Allen called on his grandfather to “turn your head” to see what’s down the road.Perhaps he was also asking the bush to see aspects of itself through new eyes?Apart from anything else, imagine how fabulous the statues will be.Michael Burge’s debut novel Tank Water (MidnightSun Publishing) explores the subject of gay-hate crimes in rural Australia Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletterJoin the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community"

You watch Grand Designs, and all architects do is cost the client money.”In a town of just over 5,000, Neilsen’s Regional Design Service is also hoping to educate the community about the power of architecture in a rural context.But while there has been a positive change in attitude during the last six years, Nielsen says creating a groundswell in rural architecture is a “massive” and “multifaceted problem”.I never thought as an architect that people would be grateful for my designPhillip Nielsen“You have to do everything in the country … you have to be the advocates and the architects,” he says.Regionally based architects have long been frustrated that their metropolitan colleagues have attracted all the limelight. At the same time, for rural residents interested in engaging an architect, it can be hard to find one in many small towns.The Regional Architecture Association was born in 2021 out of frustration at the lack of attention being paid to regional practice and it has quickly attracted members from across Australia united by the same problem.“It is something that we’re quite passionate about as an organisation, that regional architecture should be done by regional architects,” says Sarah Aldridge, architect and secretary of the RAA.Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter“It’s not that easy for someone from another area to jump in and be able to pull off a building. The relationship to the land, country and climate is different everywhere. We do see some fairly inappropriate buildings go up sometimes, because that hasn’t been considered.”Regional projects can suffer a range of issues, from increased costs of doing business to labour shortages, but Nielsen also worries about more deep-seated issues affecting the progress of regional architecture.The Exoskeleton House by Takt, whose co-founder Katharina Hendel says ‘people are much more clued in to what’s possible’.

It has since completed residential and commercial projects including farmhouse restorations, shopfront refurbishments and the award-winning, community-focused Urana Aquatic Leisure Centre.And while he is eager to champion sustainable design, Nielsen says education comes first.“Flood design and bushfire-responsive design should organically fall into place … We know how to design them, but if the community can’t see the value, then it won’t happen,” he says.For Takt, an architecture studio based between Thirroul and Moruya in New South Wales, designing for bushfires is top of mind.After spending several weeks helping at the recovery centre in Conjola in the aftermath of the 2019 New Year’s Eve fire, co-founder Katharina Hendel began to hear people considering the future of the town.“For the first few weeks, it was about quite basic needs and then we heard more questions about how to fix things and how to rebuild,” says Hendel.Now, almost three years on, Takt’s plans for the Bushfire Resilience Centre, a commemorative museum and cultural centre in similarly devastated Cobargo, further down the NSW south coast, are in development application stages with Bega Valley shire council.Sign up to The Rural NetworkFree newsletterSubscribe to Gabrielle Chan’s fortnightly update on Australian rural and regional affairsPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are at least 20 if not 30 years behind in regard to the science and the ethics.”Oogjes said the government was playing catch-up with retailers and most farmers who have already begun to voluntarily phase out the use of laying cages. She said regulators had an obligation to bring forward the 2036 deadline and bring the standards in line with market demand.“By 2025, only two years away now, each of the major supermarkets will not be selling any caged eggs at all,” she said. “The trend is absolutely under way.Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter“It’s so sad that the law is behind the community’s view – and indeed the supermarkets’ view – that cages have to go.”The 2036 phase-out was announced in August and was criticised at the time as too lax by animal welfare groups and too strict by farmers.Oogjes said the criticism was only coming from a small number of farmers ho had invested in “outdated” infrastructure. She said the main barrier was balancing the various political interests of state governments, some of which held back the reforms. Jed Goodfellow from the Australian Alliance for Animals said he hoped that state agricultural ministers would negotiate a faster phase-out when they met in February.“It’s a bit disappointing, we should be able to do it faster,” Goodfellow said. “And it really just comes down to Australia being a federated country, we’ve got to get agreement from all states and territories. And, unfortunately, we’ve seen the New South Wales government in particular, dragging the chain.” NSW has the largest proportion of cage egg producers in the country, he said, and the state government has been “sensitive to the views of the egg industry” in negotiating national reforms.But he stressed that the 14-year timeframe was only a recommendation at this stage and there was still time to alter any national agreement for the better.Goodfellow said arguments against banning battery cages were losing validity in the face of overwhelming public sentiment and retail demand for free range eggs.“The writing has been on the wall in terms of the phase-out of cages for many, many years,” he said. “So the industry has had plenty of time to adjust, and now they’re getting another 10 years.”New Zealand bans battery cages for hens – but replacement ‘just as bad’Read moreHe said with that kind of lead time, there was no room for the industry to mount an argument that it wasn’t prepared for the change. “We see year on year at the supermarket level that when consumers can make the distinction between the caged egg and cage-free eggs, they’re moving more and more towards the cage-free segment,” Goodfellow said.The industry groups Egg Farmers Australia and Australian Eggs declined to comment on the New Zealand ban. In August Egg Farmers Australia said it was “dissatisfied” with the new guidelines and that the phase-out should be pushed back to 2046.

Apart from missing friends in the big smoke, I could no longer get from my front door to an international airport in half an hour, which for a travel writer was a handy thing to be able to do.While the upsides of life in the northern New South Wales town of Glen Innes far outweigh the extra travel time and expense, at times I do wonder just how many days – or rather weeks – of my life I’ve now lost travelling those extra miles.Up here in the New England highlands, the Glen Innes airport hasn’t seen a commercial plane for about 15 years. So if I want to fly to Sydney I need to go through Armidale, which takes roughly four hours after factoring in driving time, airport time and flight time.Flying used to be my default mode of transport to Sydney but in the past few years I’ve been driving instead. Sure, it takes seven hours and petrol is expensive but it’s still a lot cheaper than flying.Like on so many routes around Australia and the world, air fares between Armidale and Sydney have been steadily working their way up. One-way QantasLink flights now start at $212, while Rex has flights from $149, along with a Jetstar-style total carry-on weight (so that’s your carry-on and personal item) of 7kg, meaning it could cost more at the gate.Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletterThe last train pulled into Glen Innes in 1988 but there is the option of getting a coach to Armidale and the train the rest of the way for about a quarter of the price of a Qantas flight – and 10 hours of your time.That means travelling to Sydney for a one-day event requires two nights of accommodation.And yet I live in hope of better regional transport routes and keep my eyes on positive glimmers on the horizon.Hopefully, as more tree changers  bring with them expectations of being able to fly to a capital city, the airlines will respondIn the 2019-20 federal budget the government committed $100m to competitive grants in the Regional Airports Program to be shared over four years. So far, approved grants have included $6.6m for Bega Valley shire’s Merimbula airport, $5m for the Ballarat airport and, up in my corner of state, $1.5m for Armidale airport and almost $500,000 for Inverell airport.The money is being used on a range of upgrades, including extending and strengthening runways so larger planes can land, installing new LED runway lighting systems to improve safety and allow flights to operate in low-visibility weather and building aircrew rest facilities.Armidale’s latest cash injection comes after a $10m upgrade in 2017 that helped build a new terminal complete with a baggage belt (no more collecting bags off the back of a trolley for us!) and cafe area. Now we just need someone to run the shuttered cafe so we’re not left waiting for our caffeine and snack fix on the plane.Since the start of the pandemic Qantas has added more than 50 new routes, including 38 regional QantasLink services. The QantasLink CEO, John Gissing, has credited both the surge in domestic tourism and growth of economic and industrial hubs in regional communities for the new flights.Sign up to The Rural NetworkFree newsletterSubscribe to Gabrielle Chan’s fortnightly update on Australian rural and regional affairsPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now the same plane flies directly to Brisbane and since 2019 has been flying via Narrabri to Sydney too.Other new Link Airways routes include Canberra to Coffs Harbour and as of August Link passengers can earn Velocity points to be used on Virgin flights, with plans to expand the program so points can be used on Link flights too.Meanwhile, the long-announced regional airline Bonza is still waiting for regulatory approval from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. If all goes well, they are planning to fly Shazza, Bazza and Sheila (these are the names of the planes, although sometimes it could also be the passengers) on lots of new routes, including Tamworth to Melbourne and Coffs Harbour to the Sunshine Coast.As for my home town, we are waiting to find out if there is any joy in the latest round of Regional Airports Programs grants and the council has been working on a new airport master plan that could see smaller commercial aircraft coming back to Glen Innes.Hopefully, as more tree changers embrace country living and bring with them expectations of being able to fly to a capital city, the airlines will respond. Until then I’ll be catching up on my podcasts on the long seven-hour drive. "

69,Alzheimer’s  US FDA approves breakthrough drug Lecanemab              Drug works with the body’s immune system to clear amyloid protein buildup from the brain            US FDA approves breakthrough drug Lecanemab,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/06/fda-approves-breakthrough-alzheimers-drug-lecanemab,"The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Lecanemab, a breakthrough drug to treat Alzheimer’s, that is manufactured by biotechnology companies Biogen and Eisai.The drug is an intravenously-administered humanized monoclonal antibody that targets amyloid, the toxic protein in the brain linked to the cognitive disease.Lecanemab, marketed as Leqembi, works with the body’s immune system to clear amyloid protein buildup from the brain.Dr Billy Dunn, the director of the Office of Neuroscience in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said: “Alzheimer’s disease immeasurably incapacitates the lives of those who suffer from it and has devastating effects on their loved ones. This treatment option is the latest therapy to target and affect the underlying disease process of Alzheimer’s, instead of only treating the symptoms of the disease.”Findings from the clinical trial of the drug found “Lecanemab reduced markers of amyloid in early Alzheimer’s disease and resulted in moderately less decline on measures of cognition and function than placebo at 18 months but was associated with adverse events”.The most common side effects of the drug were infusion-related reactions, headaches, and Aria (amyloid-related imaging abnormalities), which presents itself in the form of brain swelling and bleeding. Symptoms include headache, confusion, dizziness, vision changes, nausea and seizure. Some patients in the clinical trial experienced headaches, vision problems and confusion.The significance of amyloid protein in Alzheimer’s was first discovered by the British geneticist and molecular biologist Prof Sir John Hardy more than 30 years ago.Upon detection of the amyloid protein in the brain, a physician may recommend Lecanemab to be administered, via a drip bag every two weeks.Also under review is whether or not the drug will be covered by Medicare, the US government’s national healthcare system for seniors – those most at risk for Alzheimer’s.Lecanemab must be priced lower than $20,600 a year to be cost effective, according to the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review.Few other drugs have been found to be successful in treating Alzheimer’s. Another drug, Aducanumab, approved by the FDA in June 2021, is the first therapy to demonstrate that removing amyloid is likely to reduce decline in cognitive function. But approval of these drugs have faced criticism within the scientific community.There has been some criticism of drugs used to treat Alzheimer’s, largely to do with the speed at which they were approved.The FDA approved both Aducanumab, which is marketed as Aduhelm, and Lecanemab on an accelerated timeline, which would normally take years to get approved.The FDA offers fast-track approval to certain drugs with uncertain benefits if they are for serious diseases for which few treatments are available. Health experts argue there is no conclusive evidence Aducanumab slows down the neurological disease. Aducanumab costs $56,000 per year and Medicare does not cover the drug unless the patient is enrolled in an approved clinical trial.The Alzheimer’s Association filed a formal request in December last year, asking the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to provide full and unrestricted coverage for FDA-approved Alzheimer’s treatments.Alzheimer’s affects nearly 6.5 million Americans. In order to find out if someone is at risk for developing Alzheimer’s, a positron-emission tomography (PET) scan can determine if the amyloid protein is present in the brain, but this can cost thousands of dollars and Medicare limits its coverage of these scans. Another cerebrospinal fluid test, or “spinal tap”, can detect the presence of the protein, but its painful and invasive nature deters many patients."
70,"Brexit  Thousands of Britons expelled from EU since end of transition period              More than 2,250 UK nationals ordered to leave bloc between January 2021 and September 2022            Thousands of Britons expelled from EU since end of transition period",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/06/brexit-thousands-britons-expelled-eu,"More than 2,250 British citizens were ordered to leave EU member states between the end of the Brexit transition period and September last year, according to figures from the bloc’s statistical office.Quarterly data published late last month by Eurostat shows a total of 2,285 UK nationals were expelled from 1 January 2021, when British citizens lost their free movement rights within the EU, until the third quarter of last year.Experts cautioned that the data did not specify why people were ordered to leave so not all expulsions may have been related to residency rules, but said the figures amounted to “the starkest possible reminder” of the consequences of Brexit.“British citizens are now third-country nationals in the EU and those who are not covered by the withdrawal agreement are subject to domestic immigration laws,” said Prof Michaela Benson of Lancaster University, who has co-led several research projects on post-Brexit migration, citizenship and identity.The Eurostat data, first reported by the Local, showed striking variations between EU member states, with Sweden accounting for nearly half (1,050) of all British citizens ordered to leave over the period and the Netherlands almost a third (615).Malta told 115 UK nationals to leave its territory, France 95, Belgium 65, Denmark 40, Germany 25 and Austria 10, while some countries with large populations of British residents, including Spain, Portugal and Italy, reported no expulsion orders.Benson said the contrasts most likely reflected domestic policy differences on immigration, registration requirements, and recording and reporting. “Denmark obviously has a notoriously tough approach to all immigration,” she said.The Guardian has reported the cases of two British nationals, Phil Russell and Will Hill, who were ordered to leave because they did not know until too late they had to apply to stay in Denmark after Brexit and their applications were a few days late.Sweden and the Netherlands had particularly strict registration requirements processes even for EU nationals, while Spain is known to have asked some UK nationals to leave but has seemingly not reported it.Jane Golding, co-chair of the British in Europe group, said there were “worryingly high” numbers of orders to leave in some countries but the data did not distinguish between people who arrived after December 2020 and those resident before, who should in principle have rights under the Brexit withdawal agreement.“Without further information, we cannot tell whether there are withdrawal agreement implementation problems in some of those countries that need to be investigated,” Golding said.Benson said some of those ordered to leave may also have found themselves “accidentally” in EU member states as a result, for example, of Covid lockdowns, while others could have been subject to judicial orders, for example after committing crimes.Comparisons with previous years are not possible because British citizens were not classed as third-country nationals so the data is not available, but it seems likely many of those ordered to leave since January 2021 have fallen foul of post-Brexit residency rules.Sign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And that’s a consequence of Britain leaving the EU.”Under the terms of the withdrawal agreement, UK citizens who were legally resident in one of the EU’s 27 member states at the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020 were eligible for permanent residence, protecting their basic rights.Fourteen countries, including Spain, Germany, Portugal and Italy, opted for systems automatically conferring a new post-Brexit residence status on legally resident Britons, with no risk of losing rights if any administrative deadline is missed.The remaining 13, however, required UK nationals to formally apply for their new post-Brexit residence status, with many setting cut-off dates.Those who missed the deadline – many of whom have said they were not properly informed of their need to apply – as well as new arrivals since January 2021 are now subject to EU member states’ immigration, residency and visa laws for third-country nationals."
71, Play Video   'He wanted me to hit him back'  Prince Harry saw ‘red mist’ in William during brother’s alleged attack              Duke of Sussex recounts altercation with brother in newly released clip from ITV interview            Prince Harry saw ‘red mist’ in William during brother’s alleged attack,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/06/prince-harry-saw-red-mist-in-william-during-alleged-attack,"Prince Harry has said he saw “the red mist” in his brother, Prince William, when his older sibling allegedly attacked him during a confrontation over the younger duke’s relationship with Meghan Markle.In a newly released clip from ITV’s forthcoming interview with Harry, the Duke of Sussex said his brother, William, was so frustrated during the 2019 incident he saw “the red mist in him”.“He wanted me to hit him back, but I chose not to,” he says of his brother, who he earlier claimed in his book had physically attacked him – as was first reported by the Guardian.The book’s revelations are spread across front pages of almost every national newspaper in the UK and are likely to reduce the possibility of a reconciliation between the Sussexes and the rest of the British royal family.In the clip, released early on Friday morning, Harry tells the interviewer, Tom Bradby: “What was different here was the level of frustration, and I talk about the red mist that I had for so many years, and I saw this red mist in him.”The duke first recounted the confrontation in his autobiography Spare – an extract from which was reported by the Guardian on Thursday. In the book, it is claimed the Prince of Wales grabbed Harry’s collar and knocked him to the floor, ripping his necklace and shattering a dog bowl under his back.This video has been removed. This could be because it launched early, our rights have expired, there was a legal issue, or for another reason.Prince Harry talks about calling brother William 'arch-nemesis' in memoir – videoThe duke also states he wants to reconcile with his family – something he says cannot happen without “some accountability”.“I want reconciliation,” he says, “but, first, there needs to be some accountability.”In a clip from another forthcoming interview, Harry admits he was “probably bigoted” before his relationship with Markle.In a new teaser for a CBS News interview that is due to air this Sunday, Harry tells the interviewer Anderson Cooper he was “incredibly naive” about how the British media would treat his relationship with the American actor.“The race element” to the couple’s relationship had been “jumped on straight away” by the British press, he tells the programme, adding that he had no idea how “bigoted” the UK media was until his wife and their relationship were thrust into the spotlight.“What Meghan had to go through was similar in some part to what Kate and what Camilla went through – very different circumstances,” the duke says in the 30-second clip released on Thursday. “But then you add in the race element, which was what the press – (the) British press jumped on straight away.“I went into this incredibly naive. I had no idea the British press were so bigoted. Hell, I was probably bigoted before the relationship with Meghan.”Cooper responds by asking the duke: “You think you were bigoted before the relationship with Meghan?”Harry replies: “I don’t know. Put it this way, I didn’t see what I now see.”Kensington Palace and Buckingham Palace have declined to comment.Elsewhere in the Brady interview clip, Harry addresses the drug use detailed in the book, Spare. Bradby tells the duke: “There’s a fair amount of drugs (in the book). Marijuana, magic mushrooms, cocaine. I mean, that’s going to surprise people.”The duke appears to agree and says it was “important to acknowledge”.The show, called Harry: The Interview, will be broadcast on ITV1 and ITVX at 9pm on 8 January."
72,"Afghanistan  Aid at risk from Taliban ban on women, warns United Nations Aid at risk from Taliban ban on women, warns United Nations",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/06/afghan-aid-at-risk-from-taliban-ban-on-women-warns-united-nations,"The UN’s lead humanitarian coordinator has said UN-supplied aid cannot continue if the Taliban do not lift their ban on women working for humanitarian aid agencies in Afghanistan.Martin Griffiths, the head of the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, is due to visit Kabul shortly to discuss the impasse.Although he said he did not want to pre-empt talks and was willing to examine workarounds on the ban, his remarks suggest a standoff is developing between the UN and the Taliban that could lead to billions in aid being cut off in the long term.There are already reports that hundreds of children are turning up at hospitals with pneumonia during the harsh winter. As many as 150 NGOs and aid agencies have suspended all or part of their work due to the ban. The UN as an organisation is not yet subject to the same ban on women working, but much of its aid programme is delivered by NGOs.Griffiths said UN flights carrying cash for humanitarian aid into Kabul had already been suspended pending a pause in the Taliban ban. The aid is supplied in cash due to US sanctions.Griffiths told the BBC: “Without women working, we can’t deliver for the people who are in fact the primary objects of humanitarian assistance for women and girls. So it’s a practical matter. It’s beyond rights. It’s also practical”.He added: “There’s a lot of experience in Afghanistan, even today, where there is an edict, but it’s not enforced in a consistent way in different parts of the country. There are parts of the country now where women can work. So we will be doing everything we can to work around and make things work. I don’t want to speculate at this point as to what happens if the edict isn’t universally [enforced], but I have to say, I can’t see how we would continue.“We will do everything we can to be able to remain and stay and deliver. These are particularly difficult circumstances, I can’t remember a place where we have faced such a series of impediments. But humanitarians spend their lives negotiating, as well as delivering.”He continued: “We’re there for 28 million people in Afghanistan. It’s the largest humanitarian aid programme in the world and so it’s a body blow against our capacity to deliver.”The ban was imposed on women working in NGOs three weeks ago after the Taliban based in Kandahar said there was evidence the hijab was not being strictly enforced.There have been signs that some ministries did not agree with the ban, but experience since August 2021 when the Taliban retook control of the country is that hardline Pashtuns based in Kandahar ultimately hold sway, leaving other Taliban members to explain and implement their decisions. Many aid agencies are testing whether the ban is being imposed in practice in local communities, especially in the health sector.Griffiths also sought to refute “unhelpful calumnies” that UN humanitarian aid is being subverted by the Taliban setting up bogus aid agencies that then siphon off aid for Taliban use.Griffiths said “the money is numbered and tagged and used for the purposes for which it is given. It is used by humanitarian agencies by the UN system. It isn’t somehow leaked to the street. So yes, funds go in. But they’re very tightly controlled.“I wouldn’t agree with the notion that the Taliban is relying on international funding for its survival. Taliban is raising money through taxes, through all kinds of sources and its administration of Afghanistan. I don’t think the UN system is that banker”.Afghanistan’s deputy prime minister Mawlavi Abdul Kabir continued to send out mixed signals about the ban, telling the secretary general’s deputy special representative for Afghanistan, Markus Potzel, in a fresh meeting that learning religious and modern sciences was the right of every Afghan, including women. He said the government was still working on the details of how women could be educated.The UN security council is expected to discuss the NGO crisis at a closed-door meeting sought by Japan and the United Arab Emirates on 13 January before Griffiths’ departure to Afghanistan."
73,China  Wave of celebrity Covid deaths sparks concern over actual toll Wave of celebrity Covid deaths sparks concern over actual toll,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/06/china-covid-wave-of-celebrity-deaths-sparks-concern-over-actual-death-toll,"A spate of deaths among celebrities and public figures across China has sparked concerns that the actual death toll from Covid-19 may be far higher than authorities are reporting.Many on Chinese social media have been mourning the death of actor Gong Jintang, who died aged 83 on New Year’s Day. He was known for his portrayal of Father Kang in the sitcom Kang’s Family, which first aired in 2000.Anxious lunar new year period in China as millions travel while Covid spreadsRead moreGong, who had been a household name for years in China, had his death reported by local media, but the cause of death was unclear.“I’m so upset. [Gong] represents our memory for two generations,” one person said on Weibo, the Chinese microblogging platform.Last month, Beijing opera fans were shocked by the sudden passing of Chu Lanlan, a 40-year-old soprano who performed during the 2008 Beijing Olympics. An obituary released by Beijing Opera Arts College said that Chu, who taught at the institution, died of illness. Her family said they were saddened by her death, but did not elaborate on its cause, local media reported.China last month relaxed its zero-Covid restrictions, leading to a surge in infections, with hospitals and crematoriums quickly overwhelmed.Opera singer Chu Lanlan in an interview with CGTN. Photograph: CGTN AmericaIn late December, China’s National Health Commission stopped publishing daily Covid data. The World Health Organization earlier this week criticised China’s “very narrow” definition of Covid deaths, warning that official statistics were not showing the true impact of the outbreak.China has recorded only 22 Covid deaths since December and has dramatically narrowed the criteria for classifying such fatalities, meaning that Beijing’s own statistics about the unprecedented wave are now widely seen as not reflecting reality.The recent deaths of public figures like Gong and Chu has led many in China to question official Covid data.Under a Weibo hashtag that reads “the first Covid wave did not cause a massive amount of deaths”, which refers to a December quote from a Chinese health official, many Chinese internet users angrily questioned what they called a huge underestimate in the death toll. The hashtag had more than 220m views by Friday afternoon.“Whether it is academicians or celebrities … or my relatives and friends in close contact, I really feel many people have died, but experts keep saying that was not the case,” one person commented.Another user said: “I beg those adults who can’t see the ants on the ground to see how many people have passed away due to Covid. Just how many people who have great contributions to the country have died? And these were all celebrities.”Wang Jingguang, an award-winning film director best known for his 2013 movie Never Come Back, was also among the recent deaths, dying last month aged 54.Ni Zhen, an 84-year-old renowned Chinese scriptwriter, died last month. Ni was known for writing the classic 1991 film Raise the Red Lantern.Retired soccer star Wang Ruoji was also among the deaths last month. Chinese state media reported that Wang died of Covid at the age of 37.“Many public figures have died, with many of them passing at a young age,” Weibo influencer Haishang Yilanghua, who has 364,000 followers, wrote last month. “These deaths were made public, but there were still many other ordinary people who suffered and died that was not posted online.”Xiaoqian Zhu contributed to this report"
74,US  Biden administration seeks to limit deadly air pollution Biden administration seeks to limit deadly air pollution,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/06/biden-administration-limit-deadly-air-pollution,"The Biden administration is proposing lower limits for a deadly air pollutant, saying tougher standards for soot from tailpipes, smokestacks and wildfires could prevent thousands of premature deaths a year.A proposal released on Friday by the Environmental Protection Agency would set maximum levels of nine to 10 micrograms of fine particle pollution per cubic meter of air, down from 12 micrograms set a decade ago under the Obama administration. The standard for particle pollution, more commonly known as soot, was left unchanged by then president Donald Trump, who overrode a scientific recommendation for a lower standard in his final days in office.In a development that could lead to an even lower standard, the EPA said it also would take comments on a range of ideas submitted by a scientific advisory committee, including a proposal that would lower the maximum standard for soot to eight micrograms. A microgram is one-millionth of a gram.‘Dramatic’ rise in wildfire smoke triggers decline in US air quality for millionsRead moreThe EPA administrator, Michael Regan, said the proposal to strengthen the national ambient air quality standards for fine particle pollution would help prevent serious health problems, including asthma attacks, heart attacks and premature death that disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. Those populations include children, older adults and those with heart and lung conditions as well as low-income and minority communities throughout the United States.“This administration is committed to working to ensure that all people, regardless of the color of their skin, the community they live in or the money in their pocket, have clean air to breathe, clean water to drink and the opportunity to lead a healthy life,’’ Regan said at a news conference. “At EPA, we are working every single day to create cleaner and healthier communities for all and have been doing so for over 50 years.’’The EPA’s proposed rule, however, overlooks the recommendations of its clean air scientific advisory committee, which suggested a standard of eight micrograms per cubic meter for soot. The agency said it will listen to public comments on toughening the standard further to this level but the proposed rule disappointed clean air advocates.“Current science shows that stronger limits are urgently needed,” said Harold Wimmer, president of the American Lung Association, who added that the new limit “falls far short of what is needed to meet the White House’s stated goals of furthering public health and environmental justice”.“This draft rule misses the mark and does not adequately slash soot pollution, protect public health, or prevent premature deaths,” said Matthew Davis, a former EPA scientist who is now senior director of government affairs at the League of Conservation Voters.“EPA has a massive opportunity to strengthen this standard and build a future with cleaner, healthier air for our children, especially for communities of color and low wealth communities disproportionately near polluting coal power plants, industrial facilities, truck depots and freight corridors.”EPA scientists have estimated exposure at current limits causes the early deaths of thousands of Americans annually from heart disease and lung cancer as well as causing other health problems.Dr Doris Browne, president of the National Medical Association, the oldest and largest national organization representing African American physicians, hailed the EPA’s proposal as “the bold action needed to protect public health across the country”.Appearing with Regan at a news conference, Browne said the proposal is likely to have lasting benefits across the country “but especially for those communities of color and low-income communities that experience the increase in particulate matter pollution”. Smog, soot and other pollution near factories, power plants and other hazards has a “devastating impact on public health”, she said.A 2022 report by the American Lung Association found that 63 million Americans live in counties that experience unhealthy daily spikes in soot pollution and 21 million live in counties that exceed annual limits for soot pollution. Most of those counties were in 11 western states, the report said. People of color were 61% more likely than white people to live in a county with unhealthy air quality, the report said.Fresno, California, displaced Fairbanks, Alaska, as the metropolitan area with the worst short-term particle pollution, the report found, while Bakersfield, California, continued in the most-polluted slot for year-round particle pollution for the third year in a row.The EPA will accept comments on the proposed rule through mid-March and will hold a virtual public hearing over several days. A final rule is expected this summer. "

The two-year-old online survey asked for the first time about displacement from natural disasters in results released on Thursday.Los Angeles is becoming too hot to bear. Can it design its way cooler?Read moreSome states were affected more than others. In Florida, nearly 1 million people, or about one in 17 adult residents, were displaced in a state that was ravaged by Hurricanes Ian and Nicole in the fall. More than 409,000 people – or almost one in eight residents – were displaced in Louisiana, which had a comparatively calm hurricane season in 2022 even though residents still were dealing with the devastating impacts from Hurricane Ida the previous year.Among the states with lowest rates of the adult population being displaced by disasters were Indiana, Maine, North Dakota, Ohio and Oklahoma.Of the 3.3 million displaced adults, more than a third were out of their homes for less than a week. About one in six residents never returned to their homes, according to the survey.The demographic makeup of the displaced did not deviate much from the overall race and ethnic background of the US population, but they tended to be poorer. About 22% of the displaced adults reported having a household income of less than $25,000 a year, compared to 17.4% for the overall US population.The Census Bureau sent invitations to more than 1m households to participate in the experimental survey and collected a total of 70,685 responses in mid-December.

76,Sinaloa  Cartel launches violent response as Mexico recaptures El Chapo’s son Cartel launches violent response as Mexico recaptures El Chapo’s son,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/05/mexican-authorities-recapture-drug-lord-el-chapo-son,"Mexican authorities have captured Ovidio Guzmán, a son of incarcerated drugs kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, prompting a wave of retaliatory attacks from cartel gunmen in the northern city of Culiacán.After a night of violence, gunmen exchanged fire with security forces, blocking roads with burning vehicles and shooting at army helicopters and police aeroplanes bringing reinforcements to the city.According to one resident, heavy fighting raged for hours after Guzmán – a key figure in the Sinaloa cartel since the arrest of his father – was arrested in the city early on Thursday.As Mexico’s epidemic of violence rages on, authorities seem powerless to stop itRead more“They caught him at about 4am, and since then the shooting hasn’t stopped. It’s been a real mess – they’re shooting up in the air trying to bring down the [police] helicopters. The whole town is a mess,” the resident said.Cartel members also reportedly seized a Red Cross ambulance, took medical personnel from hospitals to attend their wounded comrades, threatened reporters and seized press vehicles.All major roads into the city were blocked with burning vehicles, and gunmen attacked a military air base and Culiacán international airport, where a passenger jet was hit by a bullet as it was preparing to take off, according to the airline Aeromexico.The Sinaloa state government said three members of the security forces had been killed in the clashes.“We continue to work on controlling the situation,” said Cristobal Castaneda, Sinaloa’s public security chief.The defense secretary, Luís Cresencio Sandoval, told reporters that Guzmán had been transferred to the Mexican capital after his capture by members of the army and national guard. He described the arrest as a “decisive blow against the Pacific cartel”, using another name for the powerful crime faction.The exact circumstances of the arrest were unclear: Sandoval said it followed six months of surveillance, but also appeared to suggest there was an element of chance involved. “When the armed forces set up a roadblock to stop several vehicles with improvised armour, [cartel] gunmen opened fire. Security forces recognized Ovidio Guzmán, who they managed to detain,” he said.Guzmán, 32, was previously detained briefly in Culiacán in 2019, but quickly released after a violent response from the gang in an episode which became a major embarrassment for the government of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.His recapture comes just days before a North American leaders’ summit in Mexico City next week, which Joe Biden will attend and at which security issues are on the agenda.The United States had offered a $5m reward for information leading to the arrest or conviction of Guzmán.A surge in overdose deaths in the United States, fueled by the synthetic opioid fentanyl, has led to increased pressure on Mexico to combat the organizations – such as the Sinaloa cartel – responsible for producing and shipping the drug.For Tomás Guevara, a security expert at the Autonomous University of Sinaloa, Guzmán’s arrest helps save face for Mexican law enforcement following the humiliation of having to let El Chapo’s son go in 2019.“The detention of Ovidio is finally the culmination of something that was planned three years ago,” he said.It might also herald a change in approach by the government, Guevara added, after criticism from many security experts that López Obrador had gone soft on the cartels, an accusation he denies.The president argues the confrontational tactics of his predecessors were unsuccessful and only caused more bloodshed, saying he would instead pursue a strategy of “hugs not bullets”.On Thursday morning, security forces were attempting to contain a violent reaction to the arrest in the Culiacán area by Guzmán’s associates.Movie star Sean Penn, drug lord El Chapo and a failed marine raidRead moreLocal government urged people to stay indoors and said schools and administrative offices were closed due to the violence. Unverified videos on social media appeared to show heavy gunfire, including from helicopters during the night. Street blockades had also been erected.“We ask the citizens of Culiacán not to leave home due to the blockades that have occurred in different parts of the city,” Culiácan’s mayor, Juan de Dios Gámez, wrote on Twitter.Joaquín Guzmán, 65, was convicted in New York in 2019 of trafficking billions of dollars of drugs to the United States and conspiring to murder enemies. He is serving a life sentence at Colorado’s Supermax, the most secure US federal prison.Reuters contributed to this report"

Attempts to overturn British colonial-era laws banning homosexuality in Kenya have proven unsuccessful, and gay sex remains a punishable crime with penalties that include imprisonment of up to 14 years.“It is truly worrisome that we continue to witness escalation in violence targeting LGBTQ+ Kenyans,” the Kenya Human Rights Commission said in a statement on Friday.“Every day, the human rights of LGBTQ+ persons are being violated with little consequence for perpetrators,” it added, urging the police “to conduct swift investigations and ensure the killers are apprehended and prosecuted”.The Western Kenya LBQT Feminist Forum said Chilobahad used “fashion to deconstruct gender and advocate for the rights of the marginalised group”.“We want to know as a community as Kenyans, what happened to Edwin, why he was murdered and who dropped his body at the scene,” the group’s programmes director, Becky Mududa, said.The death of Chiloba comes after another LGBTQ+ activist was found murdered in April last year."

79,"‘I feel a great sense of freedom’  The flying women of Mexico              The project is about the participation of women in the Danza de los Voladores (Dance of the flying men), a traditionally male ritual            The flying women of Mexico",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jan/06/when-women-fly-danza-de-los-voladores-mexico,"“Everytime I put on my costume and I jump off the pole I feel a great sense of freedom” says Irene García, a 33 year old voladora – or flying woman – from Cuetzalan del Progreso, a mountain town in the Mexican state of Puebla.Irene García is part of the group Caballeros Aguilas and more recently she joined the whole female group called Mujeres Voladoras de Cuetzalan. On her back she bears a tattoo of a dreamcatcher.The Danza de los Voladores (Dance of the flying men) is a prehispanic indigenous ceremony that begins with performers dancing around a 30-metre pole before climbing to the top. After securing themselves with a rope around their hips, they launch themselves off headfirst, spinning around the pole towards the ground with their arms open wide.Above: Voladores dance around the pole before climbing up and flying during the celebration of Semana Santa. Right: Irene García climbs up the voladores’ pole. Below right: Voladores atop the pole, seen from the Templo Parroquial de San Francisco de Asís, Cuetzalan del Progreso.“There are normally five participants. Four represent the natural elements: fire, water, air and wind. The fifth participant is a representation of the sun,” said Irene, who started performing when she was 15. The ceremony is one of the most impressive traditions that have existed in Cuetzalan since Prehispanic times.But until recently, the ceremony was only ever performed by men. Irene is one of a group of women in Cuetzalan who have challenged that custom, joining in the ritual and opening up new spaces for women to participate.Voladores perform during the patron festivity in Reyesogpan de Hidalgo, Cuetzalan del Progreso.Cuetzalan del Progreso sits amid mountains, forests and waterfalls. The area has a large indigenous population, of Nahua and Totonac heritage. “It’s difficult to tell where the dance first originated. I personally think the tradition of the flying dance was born in different parts of Mexico at the same time,” Irene told me.Voladores in flight in Cuetzalan del Progreso.What is sure is that the ritual has changed over the centuries. In prehispanic times it was performed as a way to communicate with the gods and ask for a good harvest. After the arrival of Spanish colonizers, the dance became a tribute to Catholic saints during religious festivities. In Cuetzalan, which has become a popular tourist destination, the ritual is nowadays not only performed during festivities but also on ordinary Sundays. Tourists flock to the main cathedral in the town square to witness the spectacle.Above: Yolanda and Xochitl Morales in their family’s milpa field.

Below: Yolanda Morales shows her cruzado, the front part of the voladores’ costum.The two warriors embroidered are the symbols of her voladores group that is called Águilas Mensajeras.The practice is normally passed down, generation to generation among the same family. But there are exceptions.Irene, for example, had no family members involved in the dance, and her mother was outraged when she first announced that she was going to join the dance. “My family were worried about the risks I would face. But eventually they supported my decision”, Irene explains.Before Irene, the first generation of flying women had to overcome many prejudices and discrimination in order to be accepted in the dance. Women were often considered too weak to fly, or they were derided for “wanting to act like men”.Jacinta Teresa, a 50 years old voladora, is currently the oldest female performer who is still actively participating in the dance.“Sometimes I felt that other flying men were jealous of me because I was allowed to perform as a woman” said Jacinta Teresa, 50, a voladora from the first generation of flying women. Jacinta is currently the oldest female performer who still actively participates in the dance.In a social context which can still be quite conservative – and in which gender roles are starkly defined – it is hard not to see the act of flying as a metaphor for liberation: the flying women represent a rupture with ancient traditions and a step towards a more equal society.Nowadays, it is increasingly common to see female participants within groups of voladores. “We know that taking part in the dance is a commitment towards our community,” says Yolanda Morales, a 22-year-old voladora from the town of Atmolón. Support for flying women has grown among the local community.A man climbs up the tree that will be cut and used as the voladores’ pole. Reyesogpan de Hidalgo.But female flyers still face some more barriers than their male counterparts. Once they get married or have kids it’s almost impossible for women to keep flying, as they are expected to take care of their household, while in many cases working full time jobs.Because of such challenges, only a few women continue to fly past a certain age. Although some of the flying women are unmarried, others have formed relationships with men in their group. This is, for example, the case of Irene, who met her partner Arturo Díaz on top of the flying pole when she was 18. They share their passion for the dance and have passed it onto their daughters, especially Nikté, who started flying at six.Above: Arturo Díaz helps his daughter Nikté to put on her eagle helmet.

Cuetzalan del Progreso, March 2022.Nikté, who’s now 12, forms part of the newest generation of voladoras. At her very young age she already shows great commitment to the tradition – and to the fight for an equal society. “I don’t understand why women couldn’t take part in the dance. In my opinion the pole symbolizes motherhood. Before the flight, we tie a rope around our belly; it’s almost like we are tied to an umbilical cord”.Irene takes up the theme, pointing to the dance’s strong connection to fertility . When a volador flies off the pole to the ground it is like a flower that lets its seeds fall off. “It’s the circle of life: we come to this earth, we grow and we die, returning to the earth”. Valeria Luongo is a documentary photographer and anthropologist who has worked on several projects with the community of Cuetzalan del Progreso since 2013."

84,"Environment  H-bombs or chicken bones: the race to define the start of the Anthropocene              Humanity is now a ‘geological superpower’ and declaring a new epoch is critical to tackling its impact, scientists say            H-bombs or chicken bones: the race to define the start of the Anthropocene",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/06/h-bombs-chicken-bones-scientists-race-to-define-start-of-the-anthropocene,"Exactly where and when did the Anthropocene begin? Scientists are attempting to answer this epochal question in the coming months by choosing a place and time to represent the moment when humanity became a “geological superpower”, overwhelming the natural processes that have governed Earth for billions of years.They could decide the start is marked with a bang, thanks to the plutonium isotopes rapidly blasted around the planet by the hydrogen bomb tests that began in late 1952, or with a shower of soot particles from the surge in fossil-fuel power plants after the second world war.Or they may choose the postwar explosion in artificial fertiliser use and its profound impact on the Earth’s natural nitrogen cycle. Microplastics, chicken bones and pesticide residues may also be among the eclectic signs used to bolster the definition of the Anthropocene. Possible other signs include lake beds in the US and China, Australian corals, a Polish peat bog, the black sediments beneath the Baltic Sea and even the human debris accumulated under Vienna. An international team of almost 40 scientists, who have been commissioned by the official guardians of the geological timescale, must select a place where layered deposits show the clear transition from the previous age to the new one. The team has come up with a shortlist of 12 sites that have now begun a series of votes – but there can be only one winner. Humanity has unquestionably changed the Earth far beyond the stability of the Holocene, the 11,700-year period during which all civilisation arose, and which will end with the declaration of the Anthropocene. The atmosphere, lakes and oceans, and the living world have all been transformed by greenhouse gas emissions, pollution and the destruction of wildlife and ecosystems. Humans also now have a greater effect on shaping the surface of the Earth than natural processes, shifting about 24 times more material than is moved by rivers.Defining the Anthropocene is vital, researchers say, because it brings together all the impacts of humans on the world, thereby giving a platform for holistic understanding and, hopefully, action to repair the damage. From a scientific perspective, a precise definition is essential for a clear basis for debate.Tractor spraying crops in a field. Photograph: Creatas/Alamy/AlamyThe first stage of voting is already underway. The site will need to show “specific physical properties in sediment layers, or strata, that capture the effects of recent increases in human population; unprecedented industrialisation and globalisation; and changes imposed on the landscape, climate, and biosphere”, according to a recent paper in the journal Science by Leicester University’s Prof Colin Waters and University College London’s Dr Simon Turner, the chair and secretary respectively of the Anthropocene Working Group (AWG).But creating a new unit of time is a big decision in geological circles and, in parallel, the AWG has also to achieve a bigger task – persuading geologists that a new epoch is justified at all.Both tasks come down to identifying clear markers of change and hundreds of scientists are doing just that. The broad markers of anthropogenic transformation include rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, recorded in trapped air bubbles in ice cores, and the huge change in the populations and locations of species, with human and livestock numbers soaring and spreading as those of wild animals plunge and vanish.But other markers offer the “golden spike” needed for a precise definition and enabling strata to record a sharp, clear rise. Principal among these is the distinctive fingerprint of radioactive isotopes, particularly plutonium, produced by cold war H-bomb tests, the first of which was carried out by the US on 1 November 1952 on the Eniwetok atoll in the Pacific Marshall Islands.Scores of above-ground tests soon followed, with some even rocketed into the stratosphere. The fallout from the tests was fast and global, circling the planet within about 18 months, until atmospheric testing was banned in 1962.“For a short period of time, they tested their new arsenal a lot,” said Turner. “That’s why you have this very unique, time-specific, global marker which is so useful for our work.”Another useful marker are tiny spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCPs), a type of tough fly ash only produced by the high-temperature burning of coal or heavy oil. “They take off with the sudden increase in numbers of thermoelectric plants after WW2,” said Turner. “They’re good at travelling on a continental scale and you find them globally because lots of continents produced them.” Work done for the AWG has revealed SCPs in Antarctic ice cores for the first time.Polyester, acrylic, nylon and polypropylene fibres were found in samples collected on the top of Mount Everest. Photograph: Baker Perry/National Geographic/PAPlastic pollution is also a marker of the Anthropocene, the scientists said. “The 1950s is when you start to see the majority of the polymers that were familiar with being invented and starting to appear in products,” said Waters, with nylon essentially replacing silk around second world war for example.Plastic waste can now be found from the top of Mount Everest to the deepest ocean trench, giving a global signal. Other scientists found in 2019 that plastic was being deposited into strata and suggested the stone age and iron age was being followed by the plastic age. However, the sharpest rise in plastic pollution comes a couple of decades after the plutonium isotopes from the H-bomb tests, though both have the advantage of never having appeared in the geological record before.Some scientists have suggested broiler chicken bones as a marker of the Anthropocene, with their production soaring from the second world war onwards. Furthermore, agricultural breeding means their skeletons and genetics are clearly different to those of their wild ancestors.“Chickens are now far and away the biggest population of birds on the planet,” said Waters. “But also two-thirds of the mass of large mammals on the planet are domesticated species - cows, sheep, pigs etc. That is clearly a big change to the populations of species, particularly given the diminishment of natural species.” WWF estimates an average 70% reduction in the population size of wild animals. These biological changes are large, but more gradual than other markers, Waters said.Broiler chickens at a farm in the UK. Photograph: A Room With Views/AlamyInvasive species introduced by humans to new regions can also be markers, the scientists said. The inadvertent import of alien species in the ballast water of ships arriving in San Francisco from Asia transformed the bay. “There was a point where 98% of the mass of all of the animal species in the bay were actually invasive,” Waters said. Pollen from introduced plant species, such as the trees used in commercial forestry, can also record change.Chemical and metal pollution show up in sediments too, said Turner: “The Green Revolution was based on artificial fertilisers and pesticides, and so you see that in sediment cores. The whole cocktail of industrial chemicals just exploded postwar.” Whether the chemicals persist in the environment long enough to be markers of the Anthropocene remains to be determined.The 12 potential locations for the site that will define the new epoch all display some of the markers, but are very varied. “Because the Anthropocene has not been formally accepted, we’re still trying to prove to people that this is not something localised, it is something you find and correlate in a whole host of different environments,” said Waters.“They all illustrate this dramatic Anthropocene transformation very well. But the sites which really stand out are the ones where you can actually see an annual resolution of layers,” said Turner, including some of the lake, coral and polar ice sites. “It’s quite astonishing that these sites detail planetary changes at annual resolutions.”Algae blooms in the Baltic Sea. Photograph: European Space AgencyAll have pros and cons. The 32-metre-long Palmer ice core from the Antarctic Peninsula is the longest record of the Anthropocene, but its remote location means the trace of some of the markers is often faint. The Baltic Sea sediments switch from pale to black as the Anthropocene starts. This is caused by pollution-fuelled algal blooms sucking all the oxygen out of the water. But the sediments do not have annual laminations. The archeological site in central Vienna gives a 200-year record, dated by artefacts, but has gaps in the record because of redevelopments.The choice of site, and therefore the official time and place for the dawn of the Anthropocene, is in the hands of the 23 voting members of the AWG, but it will then have to be passed by the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy, then the International Commission on Stratigraphy and finally be ratified by the International Union of Geological Sciences. There is a deadline too: theinternational geological congress in South Korea in 2024, when the mandate of the AWG expires. “It’s been pretty much stated that we’ve got until then to get this done,” said Waters.Prof Naomi Oreskes, at Harvard University and a non-voting AWG member, said: “As geologists, we were trained to think that humans were insignificant. That was once true, but it no longer is. The evidence compiled by the AWG demonstrates beyond any doubt that the human footprint is now in evidence in rocks and sediments. The Anthropocene is primarily a scientific concept, but it also highlights the cultural, political, and economic implications of our actions.”UCL’s Prof Mark Maslin, who co-authored The Human Planet with Prof Simon Lewis, said: “I think the Anthropocene is a critical philosophical term, because it allows you to think about what impact we are having, and what impact we want to have in the future.”Maslin and Lewis previously proposed 1610 as the start of the Anthropocene, representing the huge and deadly impact European colonists had on the Americas and consequently the world. But Maslin said agreeing a definition was more important than precisely where it is placed.“Up until now, we have talked about things like climate change, the biodiversity crisis, the pollution crisis, as separate things,” he said. “The key concept of the Anthropocene is to put that all together and say humans have a huge impact on the earth, we are the new geological superpower. That holistic approach then allows you to say: ‘What do we do about it?’”"
85,Exclusive  US prison operator running Nauru regime accused of fraud and ‘pandemic profiteering’ in Texas US prison operator running Nauru regime accused of fraud and ‘pandemic profiteering’ in Texas,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/06/us-prison-operator-running-nauru-detention-centre-accused-of-and-pandemic-profiteering-in-texas,"The private prison corporation running the Nauru offshore processing centre was accused of fraud and “pandemic profiteering” in Texas just one month after signing its lucrative deal with the Australian government.The government struck a preliminary agreement with the US-based Management and Training Corporation (MTC) in early October to provide “garrison and welfare services” to less than 100 people on Nauru, initially agreeing to pay it $47.3m for just 62 days work.In mid-November, just seven weeks after the Nauru deal, authorities in Texas opened multiple investigations into allegations that MTC engaged in “fraudulent conduct and pandemic profiteering” by deceiving the state government and collecting millions of dollars for in-prison therapeutic programming it did not provide.According to a detailed complaint submitted by prisoner rights group LatinoJustice to the Texas state audit office, MTC allegedly made prisoners sign falsified documents signalling they participated in treatment programs during the pandemic.“People were instructed by MTC staff that if they did not fill out the false timesheets, they would be disciplined or lose their parole and be forced to return to prison,” the group’s senior counsel Andrew Case wrote.John Howard’s government considered letting offshore detainees into Australia in 2002Read moreThe documents were then used by MTC to fraudulently collect payment from the state, the complaint alleged.MTC strongly denies the allegations and says it is looking forward to working “with the TDCJ and Texas State Auditor to disprove the allegations and affirm the consistent quality of MTC programming across our facilities, including during the pandemic”.Both the audit office and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice have announced formal investigations into the allegations against MTC, according to a report by the Texas Tribune.In the weeks after the allegations were made public, the Australian government extended the Nauru deal with MTC until the end of January, agreeing to pay it an extra $21.7m. An amended contract notice, published on 23 December, shows the government is now paying MTC a total of $69m for its work on Nauru.There is still no finalised contract for MTC’s work on Nauru. MTC has been named as a “preferred tenderer” and is being paid through a letter of intent, a type of preliminary agreement allowing it to begin providing services on Nauru.Jana Favero, director of advocacy and campaigns with the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, said it was “irresponsible and inappropriate” to hand a lucrative deal to a company facing such allegations. “Refugees held offshore deserve a place to call home, their basic rights and a future in which they can heal from the abuse they have suffered,” she said.“Having just voted for a more compassionate and humane type of politics, I think the public should be outraged.”In a statement to Guardian Australia, an MTC spokesperson vehemently denied the fraud allegations. The spokesperson said MTC had followed the Texas justice department’s protocols around the provision of therapeutic programs to prisoners during the pandemic, including using alternative treatment plans.“This was particularly the case in the four treatment programs identified in the complaint, each of which MTC operated within a TDCJ-controlled and operated correctional facility,” the spokesperson said.“However, in adherence with CDC and TDCJ safety guidance, the safety modifications were temporary. MTC worked diligently to restore programming to normal as soon as it was safe and permitted to do so.“The allegations of fraud against MTC relating to its treatment programs are unfounded.”MTC previously accused of ‘gross negligence’The Guardian has previously revealed that MTC was awarded the contract despite a string of scandals in the US. MTC has variously been accused of “gross negligence” and “egregious” security failures in its operation of private prisons, including failings alleged to have allowed the gang-rape of a woman in detention, the murder of two retirees by escaped prisoners, and the months-long solitary confinement of a US citizen wrongfully held in immigration detention.Favero said it was of “grave concern” that MTC took over garrison services on Nauru before it had signed a final contract with the Australian government, and was operating on the island using taxpayers’ money made available under a letter of intent.The home affairs department said it was still finalising its procurement processes for the Nauru work and that MTC Australia had been selected as a preferred tenderer.“The procurement was undertaken in accordance with the Commonwealth Procurement Rules and the Department’s robust governance framework,” a spokesperson said.‘Hardly anyone is getting off’: despite Labor’s promises, refugees needing urgent medical care remain on NauruRead more“MTC Australia is required to deliver services consistent with Nauru legislative requirements and in a manner that preserves individual human rights, dignity and the well-being of transitory persons. The Department administers an evidence based performance monitoring framework to verify the delivery of services in line with contractual requirements.”Nauru remains Australia’s sole offshore processing centre, after the detention centre on PNG’s Manus Island was ruled unlawful and ordered to be shut down by that country’s supreme court.Nauru and Australia signed a memorandum of understanding in 2021, committing to an “enduring form of offshore processing” on the Pacific island state, and the Labor government has committed to maintaining an offshore processing capability.There are currently about 90 people immured on Nauru. That cohort lives in the Nauru community, but cannot leave the island. The Australian-run detention centre is currently empty but on standby for future arrivals. This article’s headline was amended on 6 January 2023, to reflect the fact that MTC runs the offshore processing service at Nauru, but not the detention centre."

87,"    On the surface, I’ve healed from Mallacoota’s firestorm, but tears still form                 Mary O'Malley              On the surface, I’ve healed from Mallacoota’s firestorm, but tears still form ",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/dec/30/on-the-surface-ive-healed-from-mallacootas-firestorm-but-tears-still-form,"In the smoky dawn of 2 January, 2020, a naval ship arrived off the shores of Mallacoota, the scene of an apocalyptic firestorm that completely isolated the Victorian holiday town, stranding 10,000 visitors and residents. The fire was started by a lightening strike near Wingan River 40km away on 28 December, and arrived in the town two days later. Some 123 houses were destroyed.As the ship anchored, news feeds across the world were making Mallacoota momentarily famous, with images that looked pulled from a dystopian movie. A young boy steering a boat, backlit by a blood-red sky. Ghostly figures huddled along the foreshore, backlit by streaks of flame like a macabre New Year’s Eve fireworks display. No power, no water, the one road in and out cut off for what would be weeks.Too little, too late: Australia’s disaster response has been … a disasterRead moreJust 16 hours after receiving the SOS call, the crew of the HMAS Choules had assembled the resources for what was to become the largest civilian evacuation in Australian history. By 3 January, the first 1,000 evacuees were sailing away, traumatised by their experience but nurtured by naval staff who had foregone their own New Year’s holidays to help. It was a stunning example of an organised and prepared response to a disaster. It is not, from the perspective of many in Mallacoota, an example that has been emulated across the nation.Disaster preparedness is a mindset sadly lacking in all levels of government and in responses at a community level in the three years since Black Summer, says Jenny Lloyd, the inaugural deputy chair of the Mallacoota and District Recovery Association (Madra). “The fact the navy could kick in so quickly is proof that other government sectors can do this too,” says Lloyd, a former naval logistics officer.Lloyd says a key part of that preparation is acknowledging that climate change is causing sequential disasters.“Recovery is perhaps a misnomer as it implies a measurable end to a disaster which may never happen,” she says. “We need greater emphasis on continuously improving preparedness.”It is a sentiment echoed by fellow Mallacoota resident Mike Amos, who has years of experience in disaster zones around the world.“I’ve worked in a lot of developing countries where the agencies land and everyone knows who is doing what, from shelter, to water, to food etc,” he says. “This hasn’t happened here.”Amos says he sees little evidence of planning for surge capacity – the ability to assign experienced teams to respond to a disaster at a moment’s notice, with provisions in place to backfill their normal roles.“The long-term recovery piece also gets missed,” says Amos.Agencies are funded for short-term solutions, he says. They provide invaluable support in the time they are on the ground. But when they depart communities can be left in a worse position as wellbeing services are withdrawn while they are still needed.“Everyone recovers at a different pace,” he says. “For some people, the trauma triggers can be felt years after the fact.” The Princess Highway into Mallacoota on 31 December 2020, a year on from the devastating bushfires.  Photograph: Diego Fedele/Getty ImagesWorking (and volunteering) through tearsIn the day or so after the fires, as I roamed among blackened stalks under an angry red sun, tears were ever-present. I had survived the terror of the sky turning red then black. The shrieks and explosions. The swirling firestorm snaking towards us. Yet the silence of bush bereft of wildlife – the stripped, smoking earth afterwards –it felled me.In the months afterwards, as we recognised there could be no business as usual, tears were displaced by frenzied activity. With four other women, I co-founded a collective to help the town rejuvenate through the catalysts of co-working, education and social enterprise. On the surface, I’d say I’ve healed. But then quiz me another day about Black Summer and tears will form.Ask most people in this town for their one-word response to the past few years and it’s either “tired” or “exhausted”. In this town of 1,200, there are 65 community associations powered by volunteer hours and people who give their time across multiple committees. Everyone is stretched thin.The reliance on volunteers to drive recovery initiatives is not sustainable, says Madra chairperson Carol Hopkins.“Madra became a fantastic example of community-led recovery and the benefits to the town have been huge,” Hopkins says. “Being able to articulate what the town wants and needs has been vital … [But] what’s wrong with someone earning a living managing a town’s recovery initiatives?” Disaster recovery grants, while generous, are rolled out at a time when many communities don’t yet understand their needs. The grant application process can be taxing and competitive, and they rarely include wages. The load invariably falls on fatigued volunteers – some juggling full-time jobs.People gather on the beach in Mallacoota, one year after the fires.   Photograph: Diego Fedele/Getty ImagesThe emergence of grassroots organisations such as Madra, Lloyd believes, speaks to the need for a different system – and not just in disaster response. Communities such Mallacoota want to be able to co-design their own destiny and work with governments on more systemic approaches to the issues that plague rural and regional communities.One such issue – overlooked at the bureaucratic level – is the lack of young people.“If you look at our volunteer emergency services personnel there’s a lot of grey hair out there,” says Lloyd, who also volunteers with the State Emergency Services. “We desperately need young people.”That partly involves providing meaningful educational and career options to allow them to stay, as well as affordable, plentiful housing.Fatigue aside, work continues on all these fronts.There’s a maxim that’s relevant here. “There’s no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about.”Oddly, through fire and pandemic, Mallacoota has found that power. Watch this space.Mary O’Malley is a Mallacoota-based journalist and co-founder of the Wilderness Collective, Mallacoota, a social enterprise formed in response to the bushfires."

Another 12,000 Starlink launches have been approved, and SpaceX wants a further 30,000 second-generation satellites on top of that, covering the entire globe.China and Russia also have aspirations for world satellite dominance, and accusations have flown about which countries, or companies, may or may not be breaking the space rules.  These mega-constellations of satellites are increasingly photo bombing astronomers’ pictures of the night sky, ruining images and threatening their ability to make new discoveries.Satellites in low Earth orbit, including Starlink, also cause radio interference with sensitive astronomical instruments.But it is their contribution to the artificial brightness of the night sky (“skyglow”) – adding to light pollution from the illumination of the world’s cities – that has astronomers most worried.When SpaceX launched the first 60 Starlink satellites in 2019, astronomers were surprised at how bright they were, and warned they would start to affect astronomy “even in the most remote dark places”.In 2020, when hundreds more had been launched, Flinders University space archaeologist Alice Gorman warned of the “radical change”.“In a couple of generations there will be no one left alive who remembers the night sky before these satellites,” she said.The Australian government’s astronomer at large, Fred Watson, calls them the “new kid on the block” in light pollution.Are Elon Musk’s ‘megaconstellations’ a blight on the night sky?Read moreHe told the Astronomical Society of Victoria this year the number of satellites in orbit could be heading for 100,000 by the end of the decade, as it gets ever cheaper to make and launch them.Karlie Noon, an astronomer at the Australian National University, is one of the authors of a paper due out next year on light pollution and skyglow in the context of scientific, environmental and cultural heritage.She says light pollution is rapidly becoming a threat to observations that depend on extremely expensive machinery.“We’re taking pictures of the sky, and when we do that we can capture the satellites going through our field of view. When that happens we essentially have to delete that image and hope we have some time period or other channel to capture that information,” she says.“There’s a threshold of light pollution that astronomical observations can deal with at a given time and that’s about 10% – a 10% increased light or skyglow. Once we exceed that point of skyglow it becomes pretty much impossible to do scientific observations of the sky.“This is the threshold [that] billion-dollar instruments, observatories are built on.”Satellite constellation launched by Elon Musk’s company SpaceX passes over north-west London in 2020. Photograph: Stephen Chung/Alamy Live News/Alamy Live News.Nasa says such numbers not only mean an increase in orbital collisions, but the light reflections could interfere with Nasa’s own science satellites, cause streaks on Hubble Space Telescope images, and even threaten the chances of finding an Earth-destroying asteroid.Astronomer Jonathan McDowell, from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for astrophysics, has called the satellite fleets an “existential threat to ground-based astronomy”.Starlink is now available across all of Australia, enabling customers to order service country-wide https://t.co/slZbTmZmAt— SpaceX (@SpaceX) November 6, 2022Astrophysicist Dr Brad Tucker, also from the ANU, says most major astronomy organisations now have people working solely on the “growing threat” of mega constellations.“Our telescope, SkyMapper, always gets images of satellites, it’s now a phenomenon we have to deal with. It affects observations,” he says.With increasing global coordination on astronomy, and academics using data from observatories around the world, everyone is affected.Tucker partners with the Vera C Rubin Observatory in Chile, which says almost a third of its images will contain at least one satellite streak if the planned SpaceX satellites are launched.Researchers at the Rubin have warned the satellites threaten potential discoveries and will present a “significant threat to the main mission of [the observatory’s] Legacy Survey of Space and Time: discovery of the unexpected”.‘If we can’t see the constellations, we can’t access our knowledge.’Noon, a Gamilaraay woman, says Starlink and other satellites are also threatening Aboriginal cultural knowledge and messing with migratory animals’ instincts.She says First Nations knowledge is stored in stories, song, dance, the land – and the sky. The sky holds cultural knowledge and tells the stories of the changing landscape – and it’s getting harder to see.“It moves and evolves as the sky moves and evolves over time. Things like understanding the seasons from an Indigenous perspective – what the animals are doing, what the plants are doing, what the weather’s doing, this is all read from the sky,” she says.Orbital space around Earth must be protected amid rise in satellites, say scientistsRead more“From a Gamilaraay perspective, the Milky Way is so many things, it’s sky camp, it talks about Emu, Crocodile, an important creative being for us. It has all these layers. And we can barely access it.“If we can’t see the constellations, we can’t access our knowledge.”A recent Flinders University publication pointed out that while these mega-constellations help connect the world through cheap telecommunications, there is very little regulation.“Nations with large open spaces and strong cultural connections to the sky, such as Australia and Canada, are placed in a paradoxical position,” the authors write. “With mega-constellations providing broad-based benefits to marginalised and remote communities through increased access to services at the cost of interference with science and culture.”Governments need to pay attention as giant corporations enter the satellite “gold rush”, they warn.SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment. It has engaged with the problem in some ways, first developing a darker coating (for DarkSats), then switching to VisorSats to reduce the light reflections. But they are still too bright.Tucker says there are ways to tackle the problem – such as using artificial intelligence to clean up images. He points to the International Astronomical Union’s efforts to tackle the problem through a new Centre for the Protection of Dark and Quiet Skies. The centre will try to engage and educate people, raise awareness and develop technical, regulatory and scheduling solutions.Watson says the Australian Space Agency has to walk a tightrope between two goals – supporting the growing satellite industry while also supporting astronomical infrastructure. He’s optimistic it can be done, even if it gets harder to watch the stars.“Astronomy will not be the same – but it’ll still be fun,” he says."
89,Screen and heard  Is TikTok changing the way pop stars perform? Is TikTok changing the way pop stars perform?,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jan/05/screen-and-heard-tiktok-changing-pop-shows-rosalia-lorde-1975,"After a punishing two years for the live music industry, pop shows returned with full force in 2022, with many of the world’s top-tier stars jostling to see their fans in a live setting once again. Punters have been faced with an embarrassment of riches, from Harry Styles’ multi-night US arena residencies to Charli XCX’s Grecian rave fantasia to Dua Lipa’s Studio 54-esque disco spectacular.But even if you couldn’t afford the higher-than-ever price tags for big pop shows – the result of a significant labour shortage and the need for artists to recoup losses after two years without touring – it was also easier than ever, in 2022, to experience shows from afar. The year’s most-talked about tours – Lady Gaga’s Chromatica Ball, Lorde’s Solar Power tour, Rosalía for Motomami and the 1975’s At Their Very Best – felt as though they were designed to be shared on social media, with clips from each show proving inescapable on TikTok and Twitter.Each night of Gaga’s tour trended on Twitter; each new 1975 show has led to a flood of new footage of frontman Matty Healy doing all manner of outrageous things from kissing fans to eating raw meat. For fans watching online, the beats of each show became as indelible as the actual hits.The 1975 performing in Los Angeles, November 2022. Photograph: Jordan Curtis HughesTobias Rylander, who designed the 1975’s tour, says he’s always trying to put together “a show that reads well on social media”. Over his time working with the band over the past decade, he says, his designs have become increasingly “Instagram-ready” – the band’s previous tour, for example, featured vertical screens, “so people could actually hold their phone the way they wanted to and take pretty pictures.” Rylander even says that he tries to design shows “so that any fans googling or YouTubing the show will be able to tell, by the colour of the thumbnail, what year it was and what song it was”.For the 1975 At Their Very Best tour, Rylander and the band wanted to highlight the performers onstage – a shift from the bright LED screens and coloured lights of past shows – so he instead conceptualised a house set lit in white, like a theatre production. Part of this was due to Covid: Rylander says that because lighting technology, trucks and crews are “twice, if not three times” more expensive than pre-pandemic, “we couldn’t afford the big, expensive tech lights”. Rylander and the band were also conscious of their environmental impact, and the house set allowed them to build a show with few bespoke parts that would have to be shipped from continent to continent. Instead, the set is largely built of steel and aluminium, and has created “minimal landfill waste”. Still, one thing didn’t change: “We wanted the set to read well on camera, both moving image and still.”‘Theatre and TV, and a rock show and a pop show’ … Lady Gaga performs her Chromatica Ball show. Photograph: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Live NationRylander isn’t the only designer keeping fan footage in mind when working with pop stars. LeRoy Bennett, a lighting and production designer who works extensively with Lady Gaga, as well as Paul McCartney, Ariana Grande and the Weeknd, says that he and Gaga were “absolutely” thinking about social media when designing the Chromatica Ball. “I take that approach quite a bit because social media has become such a big part of the world,” he says.When conceptualising the Chromatica Ball, Bennett was drawn to the “stark, strong, harsh” world of brutalist architecture; the resulting show featured a dramatic grey set bright enough to be perfectly captured for social media and neutral enough for Gaga’s outlandish outfits to stand in stark relief. “The people way at the back have to see the artist – so when you light an artist, you have to pretty much do what you would do for a television show,” he says. “It’s a combination of theatre and TV, and a rock show and a pop show. It lends itself to that social media-friendly atmosphere.”The clean, dynamic design of the Chromatica Ball is mirrored in the sets of Rosalía, the 1975 and Lorde. Rosalía performs on a brightly lit white backdrop against which she and her dancers dance and scoot around the stage. Lorde’s show is architectural and geometric – and plainly striking enough for one fan to get a tattoo of the show’s bold centrepiece.TikTok boom … Rosalía on her Motomami tour. Photograph: Mario Guzman/EPAAll four shows look great on TikTok. In Rosalía’s, the gigantic vertical screens on each side the stage outright mimic the video-sharing app’s interface. Phones are situated around the stage for her musicians and dancers to broadcast to the screens throughout the show, with certain moments – selfie videos with fans taken from high-up, a spare ballad with a phone propped against the piano lid as she plays – echoing the familiar visual formatting and intimacy of popular videos on the platform.Chiara Stephenson, a stage designer who has worked with Björk and the xx, and who worked on Lorde’s tour, describes herself as a “theatre creature” – she trained under Michael Grandage and Christopher Oram – and says she wanted to bring a “theatrical sensibility” to the Solar Power shows. Unlike Bennett and Rylander, Stephenson says that she wasn’t thinking about social media when working on the tour, despite the telegenic setup. “With the amount of people coming to see the show over the months, you can’t get away with it just being aesthetic,” she says. “What [Lorde] is doing is so rooted and grounded in the music that the law for us was: what’s enhancing the music? What’s telling a story?”Sign up to Sleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

I mean – you can only watch so much TV.”The 1975’s At Their Very Best UK tour starts in Brighton on 8 January"

Why is TikTok obsessed with dogs that look like pizza slices, and why is that making me sad?",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jan/06/why-is-tiktok-obsessed-with-dogs-that-look-like-pizza-slices-and-why-is-that-making-me-sad,"OK Calla, apparently there is a new TikTok trend that has not yet filtered through to Instagram, where geriatric millennials like me can “discover” it. Tell me about it.Jo, I’m so glad you asked. To understand this meme, you need to know two very important things about TikTok. The first is that the good people of the clock app are absolutely mad about borzois, or Russian wolfhounds. You know, the lanky, wispy-haired dogs that look like they have just appeared on a misty bridge at midnight to ask you their riddles three.A large part of this popularity is due to a borzoi named Esper, who sadly died last year. Esper was owned by Jacob Chattman, a US actor whose account is dedicated to the animals he calls hose goats. The hose goats, in turn, are dedicated to ruining his life by howling.Nepo babies: what are they and why is Gen Z only just discovering them?Read moreThe second thing you need to know is that if a song exists, there will be a Muppet cover of it on TikTok. They often sink below the waves but occasionally the algorithm will drag one to the surface and whenever that happens, a meme is born.You had me at “lanky, wispy-haired dogs”. So what do the memes look and sound like?The essential feature of the borzoi is its extremely long nose. Just a lone pair of nostrils and then miles and miles of snout before you reach the eyes, which always convey the expression of an animal that has suffered a moral injury. They look like a stray sock with eyes on. So a few months ago, people started dueting videos of borzois with a googly-eyed sock puppet. Then people realised that if you draw two little dots on a HB pencil, that also looks like a borzoi.Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided by TikTok.

According to legend, she saved the life of Captain John Smith, stopping his execution by placing her head on his. She married Englishman John Rolfe in 1614 and died three years later in Gravesend, England, according to records. They had a son, Thomas, in 1615.Norton, the star of such films as Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery and Fight Club, said the revelation “just makes you realize what a small … piece of the whole human story you are”.The statue of Pocahontas in the grounds of St George’s church, Gravesend. Photograph: Fraser Gray/Rex/ShutterstockThe show, which helps celebrities trace their ancestral histories, also found that the Oscar-nominated actor’s third great-grandfather, John Winstead, enslaved a family including a 55-year-old man, a 37-year-old woman and five young girls, according to census records.Asked how it felt to know he was descended from slave owners, Norton said: “The short answer is these things are uncomfortable. And you should be uncomfortable with them.“It’s not a judgment on you in your own life but it’s a judgment on the history of this country and it needs to be acknowledged first and foremost and then it needs to be contended with.”Norton added that he personalized the details available in the census – “when you read ‘slave aged eight’, you just want to die”.Gates also revealed that Norton shares a distant cousin with another A-lister: actress Julia Roberts. “You and Ed share a long, identical stretch of DNA on your ninth chromosomes,” Gates told Roberts, who also had her family tree analyzed on the show.“This means that you inherited this shared DNA from a distant ancestor, somewhere in the thick of this family tree.”"
92,    I left my baby to write this. How do artists balance creativity and the ache for their child?                Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett              I left my baby to write this. How do artists balance creativity and the ache for their child?,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/06/baby-artists-creativity-child-writers-painters-mothers,"Since having a baby, I have never felt more creatively inspired, and never more frustrated. “The fire is still on, I’m just on the back burner,” I might say – one of the phrases in the artist Andi Galdi Vinko’s transcendent photo book, Sorry I Gave Birth I Disappeared But Now I’m Back.It chronicles motherhood in all its strange, visceral, leaky realism, as well as its naturalistic beauty. Recently, it has become a visual bible for me, as I wonder what it is to be on the back burner, or even to disappear, at a time when the tension between caring and creating has never felt more acute.In order to do both, you have to, it seems, put the proverbial baby on the fire escape. It’s probably apocryphal, but this is what the painter Alice Neel’s inlaws claimed she did in order to work. I’ve been savouring the book, The Baby on the Fire Escape: Creativity, Motherhood and the Mind-Baby Problem, these past months. It looks at how celebrated female artists and writers, such as Neel, Doris Lessing, Alice Walker and Ursula K Le Guin navigated the demands of motherhood into the need to create. The author, Julie Phillips, tried to find a common thread between how these women made it work, but instead was confronted with “a negative space, an impossible position”.The sculpture Mother and Child (1934) by Barbara Hepworth, who raised triplets. Photograph: Barbara Hepworth © Bowness. Photography by Jerry Hardman-JonesWhether it is relying on a network of “othermothers” for support, having a partner who does their share or more of the care, going it alone, building a career first, or finding success late – there is no easy way to be an “art monster” while also trying to raise a child.In the absence of societal encouragement or approval, women have had to find their own ways through that tension, some of them not always admirable. Some, like Lessing, lost access to their children. The common narrative continues to be that she fully abandoned them without looking back – which says it all, really. Others had strained or distant relationships with their offspring. But many flourished, too, as did their children.What these women all needed, Phillips concludes, was time. How they achieved that differed – Toni Morrison got up to write before her children woke, Le Guin didn’t, because hers would always stir when she did. But, heroically, each of them endeavoured to find ways around it. Barbara Hepworth claimed that taking as little as half an hour a day for herself, “to allow the images to build in one’s mind”, was enough to maintain her artistic consciousness while caring for triplets.They also needed a sense of self. It is so easy to be entirely sublimated by motherhood, to allow your self to be annihilated. To demand boundaries, to assert that you have a right to make art: that requires strength and conviction. It is, as Phillips has it, a hero’s journey.To put the baby on the fire escape is not to literally leave your child out in the cold. But it is the ability to put the baby out of your mind for the time required to create something else. That’s not to say you’re immune to guilt. It can feel like a constant tug of push and pull, the need to be present for your child versus the desperate need to create. It is far from easy.Many women know this – it is the tension at the heart of Sheila Heti’s book Motherhood, in which her narrator eventually decides not to sacrifice her artist self through motherhood. There was a time when I feared every baby might be a book I didn’t write. The proverbial “pram in the hall” as the “enemy of all good art” still haunts so many of us, though it is a nonsense. Furthermore, as Vinko and a long line of female artists before her have shown, the experience of motherhood also lends itself to groundbreaking works interrogating and interpreting it.I left my baby to write this, when all he wanted was to nestle close to me and feed and sleep. While writing, my body has literally ached for him. This will ease with weaning, but that knowledge sits with the fact that I will only have so many of these days, and that I have never, not since he was born, been fully present for him, because there is a treacherous part of me that will always need to write. I believe that I have the sense of self to do it, but sometimes it can feel exhausting. The temptation to put down one’s pen, or one’s paintbrush, can be immense, but, as the Swedish artist and writer Emma Ahlqvist writes in her book My Body Created A Human, “I don’t want my child to grow up having the pressure of having a parent who has given up everything in their life for them.” She concludes that, “Having limited time has made me realise what I really need in my life, and that is to make art.”The parent trap: can you be a good writer and a good parent?Read moreOf course, in order to keep going as a mother and an artist, you need an art world, or a publishing world, that is hospitable to both mothers and works about motherhood. Hettie Judah’s How Not to Exclude Artist Mothers and Other Parents is a manifesto for change at every level, from art schools to studios to institutions and beyond. As she writes, “When an artist discovers she is pregnant she should not immediately be gripped by the anxious prospect of having commissions cancelled, abandoning her studio practice and losing sight of a fruitful career. Parenthood should be the start, not the end of things.”What’s workingThe (updated, jauntier) Postman Pat theme song came on automatically after some nursery rhymes and I thought the baby was going to explode with laughter. He was in complete hysterics, particularly when the cat appeared. It was gorgeous to see, especially as he’s been having a tricky time recently.What’s notSleep, food, bottles – you name it. Teething and tummy trouble have combined to make the past few weeks a bit miserable for the little one, for whom only the breast will currently do. It’s understandable, and I’m treasuring our remaining breastfeeding time as much as I am feeling the frustration of the steps back, but I’m also keen to get some proper food into him.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author of The Year of the Cat, which will be published in January 2023"
